Escrow accounts significantly reduce the risk of non-payment or counterparty risks.\u00a0\n\n\n**Understanding the Escrow Process**\n------------------------------------\n\n\nEscrow accounts are used in transactions where there is a risk that one or both parties may not fulfil their obligations. In other words, an escrow account is used when there is a chance that something might go wrong.\u00a0\n\n\n[Escrow solutions](https://razorpay.com/x/escrow-accounts/) bring together tech, trustee and [banking](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/all-about-banking/), making escrow payments as seamless as possible. They also help with compliance, automations and making sure the entire transaction is as seamless as possible.\u00a0\n\n\nEscrow in India is used across industries and businesses in a range of transactions. The fundamental mechanism of an escrow account is as follows:\n\n\n**escrow illustrationKey Takeaways**\n------------------------------------\n\n\n* An escrow account is a special kind of account that holds money or assets until certain conditions are met.\n* Escrow accounts in India are used for real estate, digital lending, e-commerce, digital marketplaces, online gaming, and more.\n* Using escrow accounts significantly reduces counterparty risk or risk of fraud.\n\n\n\n**Escrow Agreement**\n--------------------\n\n\nAn escrow agreement is a contract between 3 agents: a buyer, a seller and an independent third party \u2013 an escrow agent. The agreement lists the terms and conditions of the escrow payment.\u00a0\n\n\nIn an escrow agreement, a depositor deposits funds or assets with the escrow agent. Once the terms in the escrow agreement are met, the escrow agent releases the money or assets to the beneficiary.\u00a0\n\n\n### **Format of Escrow Agreement**\n\n\nAn escrow agreement generally contains the following details:\u00a0\n\n\n* Names and addresses of the buyer, seller, and escrow agent\n* Description of the property or assets being held in escrow\n* Amount of money or value of the assets being held in escrow\n* Conditions that must be met before the money or assets are released\n* Fees that will be charged by the escrow agent\n* Procedures for resolving disputes\n* Time period for completing the escrow payment\n* Method for notifying the escrow agent of any problems\n* Procedures for releasing the money or assets if the transaction is not completed\n* Procedures for resolving disputes if there is a disagreement about whether the conditions of the agreement have been met\n\n\nIf these terms are not met by one or both parties, the agreement may be terminated.\u00a0\n\n\n**Types of Escrow**\n-------------------\n\n\nEscrow accounts are used in a variety of transactions across industries. Listed below are the major uses of escrow.\n\n\n\n<https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/09/Escrow.mp4>\n#### **Escrow in Real Estate**\n\n\nReal estate transactions involve huge amounts of money and are high risk for both buyer and seller, since there is the possibility that either party might not meet their obligations.\u00a0\n\n\nEscrow accounts help mitigate this risk. The escrow agent takes possession of the property and holds the buyer\u2019s money till all terms and conditions are met.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce met, the escrow agent releases the property to the buyer and the money to the seller.\u00a0\n\n\n#### **Escrow in Online Sales**\n\n\nCustomer trust in e-commerce and digital marketplaces is very important. Most customers are wary of trusting online sellers because there is the risk of receiving defective products, or even not receiving the product at all.\n\n\nTo address these risks, most e-commerce sellers choose to receive money through an escrow account, which will only release money to the seller upon delivery and verification of the product.\u00a0\n\n\nMost online marketplaces also deal with a lot of vendors. Amazon, for example, does not manufacture most of the products it sells on its marketplace. It is only a middle man between the vendors who do and the people who buy.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, money earned from sale of these products does not actually belong to Amazon \u2013 most of it has to be given to the vendor and only a part of the sales will go towards Amazon\u2019s revenue.\u00a0\n\n\nTo foster vendor relationship and trust, most online marketplaces choose to receive money from sales in an escrow account from where the money is distributed back to the vendor and the commission retained by the marketplace.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n#### **Escrow in Online Gaming**\n\n\n[Online gaming platforms](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/payment-solutions-for-online-gaming-companies-payouts/) like Dream11 and MPL allow players to play games online and win real money. To enter a game, players must pay an entry fee, out of which the prize money is paid to the winner. Till the winner is determined, the pool money is held in an escrow account to eliminate the risk of fraud.\u00a0\n\n\n#### **Escrow in Stock Market**\n\n\nSometimes, shares are issued in escrow \u2013 meaning that issued shares are not transferred to the owner until certain terms are met. In India, when a company issues shares to the public, the issuance is only valid if more than 90% of the shares are subscribed to.\u00a0\n\n\nIf less than 90% of the shares issued are subscribed to, the money is returned back to the investors. To ensure this happens, the company issuing shares is required to open an escrow account and receive subscription money to that account.\n\n\nAnother common use of escrow payments when issuing stock is for [employee compensation or bonus plans](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/vesting/).\u00a0\n\n\n#### **Escrow in Lending**\n\n\nIn [lending](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/digital-lending-vs-traditional-lending/) transactions, escrow payments are used to protect both the borrower and the lender. The borrower\u2019s funds are held in escrow until they have met the terms of the loan, such as making all of the required payments.\n\n\nThe lender\u2019s funds are also held in escrow until the borrower has met the terms of the loan. This helps ensure that both parties are protected in case of default.\u00a0\n\n\n#### **Escrow in Acquisitions and Business Deals**\n\n\nEscrow accounts are also used by companies in mergers & acquisitions and other business deals like credit sales.\n\n\nIn case of mergers, the deal amount is first deposited into an escrow account. Once the terms are met by both parties, the amount is released to the selling party.\u00a0\n\n\nIn case of credit sales, the business might open an escrow account for the funds to be held till the vendor fulfils their side of the transaction.\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, a business buys goods from a supplier on credit. The supplier agrees to deliver the goods in 30 days, and the business agrees to make the payment immediately \u2013 but the money will be transferred to an escrow account.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce the supplier delivers the goods, the business verifies condition and quality; following which the escrow agent releases the funds to the supplier.\n\n\n**Advantages and Disadvantages of Escrow Payments**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Convenient for complex transactions involving multiple parties and complicated terms | Escrow agreement and escrow transaction can be complex and confusing |\n| Reduces the risk of dispute | Can delay the transaction as verifications and third-party transfers can take time |\n| Helps ensure compliance with regulations and the law |  |\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDespite the drawbacks, there is huge benefit from using an escrow account to facilitate complex, multi-party transactions.\u00a0\n\n\nRegulations around Escrow in India\n----------------------------------\n\n\nIn India, the law mandates the use of escrow accounts for certain kinds of transactions. It is important to know what the law says about escrow accounts and whether your business needs one or not.\n\n\n* The\u00a0[**Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)**](https://www.sebi.gov.in/)\u00a0mandates the use of an escrow account when issuing shares.

This is to ensure that these payments are made on time and that the home loan borrowers are not defaulting on their payments.\n* The\u00a0**Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016**\u00a0(RERA) requires real estate developers to open an escrow account to hold the money collected from homebuyers. This is to ensure that the money is used for the construction of the project and is not misappropriated.\n* The\u00a0**Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules, 2011**\u00a0(IT Rules) require online platforms that facilitate escrow services to comply with certain regulations. These regulations include registering with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), maintaining records of all transactions, and resolving disputes in a timely manner.\n\n\nIn addition to these regulations, there are also a number of laws that apply to escrow accounts in India. These laws include the **Indian Contract Act, 1872**, the **Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881**, and the **Punjab National Bank (Amendment) Act, 2014**.\n\n\nThe regulations and laws around escrow in India are designed to protect the interests of all parties involved in an escrow transaction. By complying with these regulations and laws, escrow agents can help to ensure that escrow accounts are used safely and securely.\n\n\n#### Choosing the Right Escrow Account for Your Business\n\n\nThere are many different escrow solutions on the market \u2013 the wisdom lies in knowing which one is the right one for your needs and your business.\n\n\nRazorpayX Escrow+ is the only escrow solution on the market with automated, 10-second disbursals, all-in-one escrow, trustee and banking services and more:\n\n\n* Effortless auto-reconciliations\n* Multi-bank routing\n* Robust APIs\n* Pre-approved money flows\n* Plug & play industry modules\n\n\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is escrow account India?\n\n\n\nAn escrow account in India is a bank account where money or assets are held by a third party, called an escrow agent, until certain conditions are met.

Picture it as the lifeblood of your business, the oxygen that keeps it breathing and thriving. Yet, despite its importance, many SMEs find themselves struggling with the complexities of working capital.\n\n\nIn recent years, the number of SMEs in India has surged to nearly [6.3 million](https://www.transunioncibil.com/content/dam/transunion-cibil/documents/cmi-report-2023/msme-report-august%202023-web%20new.pdf). However,\u00a0 only 2.5 million of them have accessed credit through formal sources. These figures highlight the considerable challenges faced by small businesses when it comes to securing funding, often stemming from limited resources and a lack of collaborative opportunities.\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re a seasoned entrepreneur looking to fine-tune your financial strategies or a newcomer navigating the SME landscape, this blog article will help you understand the world of working capital management.\n\n\nSo, let\u2019s dive in and discover the art and science of working capital management, a skill set that could very well be the cornerstone of your SME\u2019s success story.\n\n\nWhat is working capital management?\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n> Working capital management is a financial strategy that involves overseeing and optimising a company\u2019s short-term assets and liabilities to ensure its day-to-day operational efficiency and financial stability. It\u2019s all about managing the liquidity and financial resources needed to run a business smoothly.\n> \n> \n\n\nSMEs must balance their assets and liabilities to run their operations smoothly. Every step a business takes to manage its current assets and liabilities is part of working capital management.\n\n\nThe end target of all functions of working capital management is to maintain enough liquidity in the business for its uninterrupted operations \u2013 such needs are often associated with the supply of labour, raw materials, wage payments, and other overhead expenses.\n\n\nUnlocking working capital management dynamics: the factors at play\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThere are two factors that decide how much cash a company needs: stuff from inside the company (we call it \u201cendogenous\u201d), and things from outside the company (we call it \u201cexogenous\u201d). These things are like puzzle pieces that fit together to figure out how much money a company should keep.\n\n\n**Endogenous factors:** These factors originate from within the company itself and encompass elements such as its size, organisational structure, and strategic initiatives. For instance, a company operating on a modest scale with a limited workforce generally demands a smaller working capital reserve. Conversely, an enterprise engaged in large-scale production must maintain a substantial working capital to procure labor and raw materials efficiently.\n\n\n**Exogenous Factors:** In contrast, exogenous factors are external to the company and extend beyond its immediate control. These encompass variables such as the availability of banking services, prevailing interest rates, the competitive landscape, and the industry in which the company operates. These external forces can significantly impact a company\u2019s working capital needs.\n\n\nHow to calculate working capital?\n---------------------------------\n\n\nThe formula to calculate working capital is as follows:\n\n\n\n> Working capital = Current Assets \u2013 Current Liabilities\n> \n> \n\n\n**Current assets:** These are assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or the normal operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. Examples of current assets include:\n\n\n* **Cash:** The money a company has in its bank accounts.\n* **Accounts receivable:** Money owed to the company by its customers for goods or services sold on credit.\n* **Inventory:** Goods held for sale, such as products in a retail store or raw materials in a manufacturing facility.\n* **Prepaid expenses:** Payments made in advance for services or expenses that will be incurred in the future, such as insurance premiums.\n\n\n**Current liabilities:** These are debts and obligations that are expected to be settled within one year or the normal operating cycle of the business. Examples of current liabilities include:\n\n\n* **Accounts payable:** Money owed by the company to its suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit.\n* **Short-term loans:** Loans that need to be repaid within one year.\n* **Accrued liabilities:** Unpaid expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid, such as wages and utilities.\n* **Bank overdraft:** The excessive funds you withdraw from your bank account above the available balance.\n\n\nLet\u2019s assume a company has a total current assets of Rs. 40 lakhs and current liabilities of Rs. 15 lakhs. In this case, a company\u2019s working capital shall be Rs. 25 lakhs. Hence, it is the cash available with the company that it can utilise to fund its operations only after setting aside money for all its current liabilities.\n\n\n\nImportance of working capital management for SMEs\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking capital management is especially critical for SMEs due to their unique financial challenges and resource constraints. Here are several reasons highlighting the importance of working capital management for SMEs:\n\n\n1. **Cash flow management:** SMEs often have limited access to external financing, making effective cash flow management essential. Proper working capital management ensures that SMEs have enough liquidity to cover day-to-day expenses, reducing the risk of insolvency.\n2. **Operational efficiency:** Efficient working capital management allows SMEs to optimise their operations. For instance, it helps in managing inventory levels to prevent overstocking or stock outs, which can be costly for small businesses with limited storage space and capital.\n3. **Supplier relationships:** Timely payments to suppliers are crucial for maintaining good relationships, securing favourable credit terms, and negotiating discounts. Effective working capital management enables SMEs to negotiate better terms and build trust with suppliers.\n4. **Customer relations:** SMEs need to collect accounts receivable promptly to maintain healthy cash flows. This requires diligent monitoring and collection efforts. Managing accounts receivable effectively helps in building strong customer relationships and ensures timely revenue.\n5. **Minimising financing costs:** SMEs often rely on short-term loans or lines of credit to cover working capital needs. By optimising working capital, SMEs can reduce their reliance on expensive financing options, minimising interest expenses.\n6. **Flexibility and adaptability:** SMEs may face rapid changes in demand or unexpected expenses. A well-managed working capital position provides the flexibility to adapt to these changes without disrupting operations.\n7. **Investment opportunities:** Effective working capital management allows SMEs to accumulate surplus cash that can be invested in growth opportunities or used as a financial cushion during economic downturns.\n8. **Risk mitigation:** SMEs are more vulnerable to economic uncertainties, market fluctuations, and unexpected events. Adequate working capital acts as a buffer against financial shocks and reduces the risk of business failure.\n9. **Creditworthiness:** Banks and other lenders assess an SME\u2019s working capital position when evaluating loan applications. A healthy working capital position can enhance an SME\u2019s creditworthiness, making it easier to secure financing when needed.\n10. **Sustainability:** SMEs often operate on thin profit margins. Effective working capital management helps ensure the long-term sustainability and profitability of the business by preventing cash flow crises that could lead to insolvency.\n11. **Strategic planning:** Working capital management provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making. It helps SMEs identify areas for improvement, allocate resources efficiently, and plan for growth or diversification.\n\n\n\nWorking capital management decision\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecisions related to management of working capital are critical for SMEs. They can impact your company\u2019s financial health and ability to seize growth opportunities. By understanding and effectively managing your working capital, you can position your SME for long-term success.\n\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n------------------------------\n\n\n### **Q1.

While this can be a viable option in some situations, it\u2019s essential to weigh the pros and cons carefully. In this blog post, we\u2019ll delve into the advantages and disadvantages of using a personal line of credit for your business to help you make an informed decision.\n\n\nWhat is a personal line of credit?\n----------------------------------\n\n\nBefore diving into whether or not you should use a personal line of credit for your business, let\u2019s clarify what a personal line of credit is. A personal line of credit is a revolving credit account that allows you to borrow money up to a predetermined limit. You can withdraw funds as needed, and interest is typically charged only on the amount you borrow. Personal lines of credit are often unsecured, meaning they don\u2019t require collateral.\n\n\nAdvantages of using a personal line of credit for your small business\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n1. **Ease of access:** Obtaining a personal line of credit can be quicker and less complicated than securing a business loan, making it a convenient option for entrepreneurs who need funds promptly.\n2. **Flexibility:** With a personal line of credit, you have the flexibility to use the funds for various business needs, including covering unexpected expenses, managing cash flow, or seizing growth opportunities.\n3. **No business history required:** If your business is relatively new or lacks an established credit history, a personal line of credit can be more accessible than business financing, which often requires a track record.\n4. **Potentially lower interest rates:** Depending on your creditworthiness, you may be able to secure a lower interest rate on a personal line of credit compared to some business loan options.\n\n\nDisadvantages of using a personal line of credit for your small business\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n1. **Personal risk:** When you use a personal line of credit for business purposes, your personal assets are at risk in case of business failure or financial difficulties. This can put your home, savings, or other personal assets in jeopardy.\n2. **Limited credit amount:** The credit limit on a personal line of credit is typically lower than what you could obtain through a business loan or other business financing methods, which may not be sufficient for larger business needs.\n3. **Mixed finances:** Mixing personal and business finances can lead to complications during tax season and when managing your financial records.\n4. **Impact on personal credit:** Late payments or high balances on your personal line of credit can negatively affect your personal [credit score](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/sme-loan-eligibility/), potentially limiting your ability to secure personal loans or credit in the future.\n\n\nMaking the decision\u2026\n--------------------\n\n\nDeciding whether to use a personal line of credit for your business should be a carefully considered choice. It may be a suitable option for small, short-term financing needs or startups with limited alternatives. However, it\u2019s crucial to weigh the convenience and flexibility against the personal risks and potential limitations.\n\n\nBefore proceeding, consult with a financial advisor or business expert to assess your specific situation. Explore alternative financing options tailored to businesses, such as business loans, lines of credit, or small business grants. Ultimately, the decision should align with your business goals, risk tolerance, and financial strategy.\n\n\nRemember that managing your finances wisely is vital for the long-term success of your business. Make informed decisions that support your business\u2019s growth while protecting your personal financial stability.\n\n\nNeed Line of Credit for Your Small Business?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nConsider exploring [Razorpay Line of Credit.](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/introducing-razorpay-line-of-credit/) This flexible credit facility can help you manage cash flow, invest in growth, and seize opportunities to take your business to the next level.

Managing cash flow, expanding operations, and seizing new opportunities become crucial to sustain and thrive in a competitive market.\n\n\nThis is where credit can play a pivotal role. In this article, we\u2019ll explore ten signs that indicate your small business may benefit from utilising credit to not only survive but also thrive.\n\n\n1. **Cash flow crunches:**Many small businesses struggle with [cash flow](https://razorpay.com/blog/top-cash-flow-challenges-in-the-travel-industry/) issues, often due to inadequate planning. Some, particularly those reliant on seasonal inventory stocking, may regularly spend more cash than they have on hand. Others face cash flow challenges because they follow different business cycles or experience seasonal fluctuations, common for small businesses with peak seasons.No matter the cause, negative cash flow can significantly impact small businesses and raise concerns. Cash flow serves as an indicator of a small business\u2019s sustainability. During growth phases, securing business funding can be a valuable tool for effective cash flow management.\n2. **Business expansion:**  \n\nExpanding a small business, especially at the outset, often necessitates acquiring new assets or real property. This could mean investing in new equipment, machinery, or real estate under the business\u2019s name, ultimately driving business growth. While the business\u2019s ongoing operations may not generate sufficient cash to cover these expansion costs upfront, a well-structured financial plan anticipates that the growth will be funded over time through business operations.\n3. **Business innovation:**  \n\nInnovation is key for small businesses, and today, it often means transitioning to online platforms.

It is essential for small business owners to proactively prepare for contingencies and emergencies. This preparedness may necessitate seeking additional funds for the business, which can be sourced from various avenues. Ideally, the business should aim to generate these funds from its operations.

This means that both parties, the payer and the payee, use electronic mediums to exchange money.\n\n\nThe Government of India has been undertaking several measures to promote and encourage digital payments in the country. As part of the \u2018**Digital India**\u2019 campaign, the government has an aim to create a \u2018digitally empowered\u2019 economy that is \u2018**Faceless, Paperless, Cashless**\u2019. There are various types and methods of digital payments.\n\n\nPlease note that digital payments can take place on the internet as well as on physical premises. For example, if you buy something from Amazon and pay for it via UPI, it qualifies as a digital payment. Similarly, if you purchase something from your local Kirana store and choose to pay via UPI instead of handing over cash, that also is a digital payment.\n\n\n[According to a report in ET, In India, 66.6 billion transactions worth $270.7 billion are expected to shift from cash to cards and digital payments by 2023.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Frazorpay.com%2Flearn%2Fdigital-payments-india-definition-methods-importance%2F&text=According%20to%20a%20report%20in%20ET%2C%20In%20India%2C%2066.6%20billion%20transactions%20worth%20%24270.7%20billion%20are%20expected%20to%20shift%20from%20cash%20to%20cards%20and%20digital%20payments%20by%202023.&via=Razorpay&related=Razorpay) [Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Frazorpay.com%2Flearn%2Fdigital-payments-india-definition-methods-importance%2F&text=According%20to%20a%20report%20in%20ET%2C%20In%20India%2C%2066.6%20billion%20transactions%20worth%20%24270.7%20billion%20are%20expected%20to%20shift%20from%20cash%20to%20cards%20and%20digital%20payments%20by%202023.&via=Razorpay&related=Razorpay)\u00a0\n\n\n\nDigital Payment Methods in India\n--------------------------------\n\n\nAfter the launch of Cashless India, we currently have ten methods of digital payment available in India. Some methods have been in use for more than a decade, some have become popular recently, and others are relatively new.\u00a0\n\n\n### #1: Banking Cards\n\n\nIndians widely use Banking cards, or debit/credit cards, or prepaid cards, as an alternative to cash payments. Andhra Bank launched the first credit card in India in 1981.\n\n\nCards are preferred because of multiple reasons, including, but not limited to, convenience, portability, safety, and security. This is the only mode of digital payment that is popular in online transactions and physical transactions alike. Nowadays, many apps are being launched with the sole purpose of managing card transactions like Cred, Square, etc.\n\n\n### #2: Unstructured Supplementary Service Data(USSD)\n\n\nUSSD was launched for those sections of India\u2019s population which don\u2019t have access to proper banking and internet facilities. Under USSD, mobile banking transactions are possible without an internet connection by simply dialing \\*99# on any essential feature phone.\n\n\nThis number is operational across all Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) and allows customers to avail of services including interbank account to account fund transfer, balance inquiry, and availing mini statements. Around 51 leading banks offer USSD service in 12 different languages, including Hindi & English.\n\n\n### #3: Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS)\n\n\nAEPS is a bank-led model for digital payments that was initiated to leverage the presence and reach of Aadhar. Under this system, customers can use their Aadhaar-linked accounts to transfer money between two Aadhaar linked Bank Accounts. As of February 2020, AEPS had crossed more than 205 million as per NPCI data.\n\n\nAEPS doesn\u2019t require any physical activity like visiting a branch, using debit or credit cards or making a signature on a document. This bank-led model allows digital payments at PoS (Point of Sale / Micro ATM) via a Business Correspondent(also known as Bank Mitra) using Aadhaar authentication. The AePS fees for Cash withdrawal at BC Points are around Rs.15.\n\n\n### #4: Unified Payments Interface (UPI)\n\n\n[UPI](https://razorpay.com/learn/what-is-upi-id/) is a payment system that culminates numerous bank accounts into a single application, allowing the transfer of money easily between any two parties. As compared to NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS, UPI is far more well-defined and standardized across banks. You can use UPI to initiate a bank transfer from anywhere in just a few clicks.\n\n\nThe benefit of using UPI is that it allows you to pay directly from your bank account, without the need to type in the card or bank details. This method has become one of the most popular digital payment modes in 2020, with October witnessing over 2 billion transactions.\u00a0\n\n\n[What took credit cards a decade or so to achieve in India, UPI had accomplished in a matter of just two years.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Frazorpay.com%2Flearn%2Fdigital-payments-india-definition-methods-importance%2F&text=What%20took%20credit%20cards%20a%20decade%20or%20so%20to%20achieve%20in%20India%2C%20UPI%20had%20accomplished%20in%20a%20matter%20of%20just%20two%20years.%20&via=Razorpay&related=Razorpay) [Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Frazorpay.com%2Flearn%2Fdigital-payments-india-definition-methods-importance%2F&text=What%20took%20credit%20cards%20a%20decade%20or%20so%20to%20achieve%20in%20India%2C%20UPI%20had%20accomplished%20in%20a%20matter%20of%20just%20two%20years.%20&via=Razorpay&related=Razorpay)\n\n\n### #5: Mobile Wallets\n\n\nMobile Wallets, as the name suggests, are a type of wallet in which you can carry cash but in a digital format. Often customers link their bank accounts or banking cards to the wallet to facilitate secure digital transactions. Another way to use wallets is to add money to the Mobile Wallet and use the said balance to transfer money.\n\n\nNowadays, many banks have launched their wallets. Additionally, notable private companies have also established their presence in the Mobile Wallet space. Some popularly used ones include Paytm, Freecharge, Mobikwik, mRupee, Vodafone M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Jio Money, SBI Buddy, Vodafone M-Pesa, Axis Bank Lime, ICICI Pockets, etc.\n\n\n### #6: Bank Prepaid Cards\n\n\nA bank prepaid card is a pre-loaded debit card issued by a bank, usually single-use or reloadable for multiple uses. It is different from a standard debit card because the latter is always linked with your bank account and can be used numerous times. This may or may not apply to a prepaid bank card.\n\n\nA prepaid card can be created by any customer who has a KYC-complied account by merely visiting the bank\u2019s website. Corporate gifts, reward cards, or single-use cards for gifting purposes are the most common uses of these cards.\n\n\n### #7: PoS Terminals\n\n\nPoS(Point of Sale) is known as the location or segment where a sale happens. For a long time, PoS terminals were considered to be the checkout counters in malls and stores where the payment was made. The most common type of PoS machine is for Debit and Credit cards, where customers can make payment by simply swiping the card and entering the PIN.\n\n\nWith digitization and the increasing popularity of other online payment methods, new PoS methods have come into the picture. First is the contactless reader of a PoS machine, which can debit any amount up to Rs. 2000 by auto-authenticating it, without the need of a Card PIN.\n\n\n [Mobile PoS terminals are those which work through a tablet or smartphone and Virtual PoS systems are those that use web-based applications to process payments.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Frazorpay.com%2Flearn%2Fdigital-payments-india-definition-methods-importance%2F&text=%20Mobile%20PoS%20terminals%20are%20those%20which%20work%20through%20a%20tablet%20or%20smartphone%20and%20Virtual%20PoS%20systems%20are%20those%20that%20use%20web-based%20applications%20to%20process%20payments.&via=Razorpay&related=Razorpay) [Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Frazorpay.com%2Flearn%2Fdigital-payments-india-definition-methods-importance%2F&text=%20Mobile%20PoS%20terminals%20are%20those%20which%20work%20through%20a%20tablet%20or%20smartphone%20and%20Virtual%20PoS%20systems%20are%20those%20that%20use%20web-based%20applications%20to%20process%20payments.&via=Razorpay&related=Razorpay)\n\n\n### #8: Internet Banking\n\n\nInternet Banking, also known as e-banking or online banking, allows the customers of a particular bank to make transactions and conduct other financial activities via the bank\u2019s website. E-banking requires a steady internet connection to make or receive payments and access a bank\u2019s website, which is called Internet Banking.\n\n\nToday, most Indian banks have launched their internet banking services. It has become one of the most popular means of online transactions. Every [payment gateway in India](https://razorpay.com/learn/best-payment-gateway-india/) has a virtual banking option available. NEFT, RTGS, or IMPS are some of the top ways to make transactions via internet banking.\u00a0\n\n\n### #9: Mobile Banking\n\n\nMobile banking refers to the act of conducting transactions and other banking activities via mobile devices, typically through the bank\u2019s mobile app. Today, most banks have their mobile banking apps that can be used on handheld devices like mobile phones and tablets and sometimes on computers.\n\n\nMobile banking is known as the future of banking, thanks to its ease, convenience, and speed. Digital payment methods, such as IMPS, NEFT, [RTGS](https://razorpay.com/learn/rtgs/), IMPS, investments, bank statements, bill payments, etc., are available on a single platform in mobile banking apps. Banks themselves encourage customers to go digital as it makes processes easier for them too.\n\n\n### #10: Micro ATMs\n\n\nMicro ATM is a device for Business Correspondents (BC) to deliver essential banking services to customers. These Correspondents, who could even be a local store owner, will serve as a\u00a0 \u2018micro ATM\u2019 to conduct instant transactions. They will use a device that will let you transfer money via your Aadhaar linked bank account by merely authenticating your fingerprint.\n\n\nEssentially, Business Correspondents will serve as banks for the customers. Customers need to verify their authenticity using UID(Aadhaar). The essential services that will be supported by micro ATMs are withdrawal, deposit, money transfer, and balance inquiry. The only requirement for Micro ATMs is that you should link your bank account to Aadhaar.\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of digital payments?\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn a country like India, where disparities are sometimes poles apart, ensuring financial equality becomes an issue of prime importance. One of the reasons why our government started vocalizing Cashless Economy and Digital India was to improve access to financial resources. There are multiple benefits that digital payments bring to the table.\n\n\n### Ease and convenience\n\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of digital payment is the seamless experience they provide to customers. Reduced dependency on cash, fast transfer speed, and the ease of transacting make online payments a preferred option. Traditional payment methods like cash and cheques add to factors like risk, steps, and physical presence. With digital payment, you can send and receive funds from anywhere in the world at the click of a button.\n\n\n### Economic progress\n\n\nCustomers transact more online when they see the ease, convenience, and security of online payments. This means that more and more people feel comfortable buying online, investing digitally, and transferring funds via electronic mediums. The increase in money movement and online business contributes to the progress of the economy. This is why online ventures are being launched every day and even more are making profits daily.\n\n\n### Safety and efficient tracking\n\n\nHandling and dealing in cash is a cumbersome and tedious task. Along with the risk of losing money, there is the hassle of carrying cash everywhere you go and keeping it safe. With digital payments, one can keep their funds secured in online format effortlessly. Nowadays, your mobile phone alone is enough to make and receive payments \u2013 thanks to UPI, netbanking, and mobile wallets. Additionally, most digital payment channels provide regular updates, notifications, and statements for a customer to track his funds.\n\n\nRazorpay Payment Gateway: Your digital payment partner\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCarrying forward the mission of Cashless and Digital India, Razorpay is India\u2019s first full-stack financial solutions provider.

Some methods have been in use for more than a decade, some have become popular recently, and others are relatively new. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Is electronic payment safe to use?\n\n\n\nThanks to advancements in digital payments technology, demographic shifts, and the evolving cyber-security landscape, online transactions are more popular and secure than ever before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is the purpose of digital payments?\n\n\n\nThe main objectives of digital transactions are to reduce the costs and risks of handling cash, increase the ease of conducting online transactions, and increase transparency among monetary transactions among people.", "[September 4, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/gpay-transaction-limit/)\n\n11 Mins Read\n\n\nExplore and learn about latest GPay per day limit in India, maximum transaction limit on Google pay, how much money you can send or receive with GPay and the maximum number of transactions you can make in one day.

Moreover, the maximum times you can send money in a day **cannot exceed 10** in Gpay or any other UPI app. If you want to transfer more money or conduct a greater number of transactions, you will have to wait for the 24-hour time period to get over.\n\n\nTo avoid any kind of cyber fraud, GPay allows you to **request a maximum limit of \u20b92000** in a day via the Virtual Payment Address (VPA) in UPI.\n\n\nWhen you download the Google pay and register as a first time user, the first transaction limit on Google pay is also **\u20b91,00,000.** However, if you have changed your phone, mobile number, or UPI PIN, you can send a maximum of **\u20b95,000** for the first 24 hours.\n\n\nAlso, as a first time setup you may have to transfer \u20b91to Google Pay to ensure setup completion. \u20b91will later be refunded back to your account.\n\n\n### **UPI Limit Per Day Across UPI Apps**\n\n\nThe total amount of money you can send across all UPI apps per day is **\u20b91,00,000**. Hence your Gpay limit per day will also depend on other UPI transfers you have done in a day. Let\u2019s say that you send \u20b920,000 through one UPI app on a particular day, then your Google pay transfer limit for that day will now be\u00a0\u20b980,000.\n\n\nIn addition to the money transfer limit on UPI transactions, NPCI has also set a limit on the maximum number of UPI transactions per day. As per new NPCI regulations, a person can make **upto 20 transactions in a day**, post which they are required to wait for 24 hours to start transacting again. Note that the **transaction limits can vary** depending on different banks.\n\n\nThe National Payments Corporation India (NPCI) has also proposed to put a 30% volume cap on all UPI apps. Currently Phonepe and Gpay have a combined **82.4% market share** in UPI transactions as per [NPCI Data](https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/upi-ecosystem-statistics#innerTabTwoJul23). This is to ensure that these UPI apps don\u2019t form a monopoly on the UPI market. However, the deadline for limiting the volume cap for TPAPs (Third Party App Providers) has been extended by 2 years up to December 31, 2024 from an earlier deadline of Jan 1, 2023.\n\n\n**Google Pay Transaction Limits for Different Banks**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDifferent banks may have varying Gpay transaction limits per day.

After all, we must know history to understand better and appreciate the present and the future.\n\n\nHistory of Technical Writing\n----------------------------\n\n\nI started writing technical documents in 2006. In those days, Technical Writing was recently introduced in India and was not a sought-after profession primarily due to the lack of awareness.\n\n\nBy the 2000s, Technical Writing was already quite popular in the West. If we look back at the history of Technical Writing, it got recognition as a profession after World War II.\u00a0 However, the practice of writing technical documents can be traced back to Classical Antiquity (the period between the [8th century BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8th_century_BC) and the [5th century AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_century_AD) centred on the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea)) in the works of Aristotle! Inventors and scientists like Isaac Newton and Leonardo Da Vinci wrote accounts of their experiments and findings in documents, which later shaped modern-day Technical Writing.\n\n\nDuring the 20th Century, the rapid advancement of technology in almost every facet of our lives \u2013 military, aerospace, computers, medicine, healthcare, and electronics, skyrocketed the demand for Technical Writers. Technical Writing as a practice has matured and has embraced many new technological advancements to its advantage, making it finer and now a much sought-after profession worldwide, including in India.\n\n\nTechnical Writing Deliverables and Tools\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you are a kid of the 80s or 90s, you would remember the manual that used to come with your television explaining how to set up the antennae and tune in the channels. Or the little pamphlets that used to come with a pressure cooker advising dos\u2019 and don\u2019ts\u2019 of using a pressure cooker \u2013 how to set it up, clean it and use it.\n\n\nThe above are two simple examples of Technical Writing artefacts.\n\n\nFollowing is a list of the many technical documents prepared by Engineers, Product Managers, Technology Specialists, IT Professionals, and Support Personnel in addition to the Technical Writers:\n\n\nHelp Systems, API documentation, Integration Guide, Product Requirement Document, Technical Specifications, Instruction Manual, User and Admin Manual, Installation and Configuration Guides, Release Notes and Readmes, Data Sheets, Proposals, Reports, White Papers, Case Studies, Website, Technical Blogs and more!\n\n\nVarious technical writing tools exist, from simple Microsoft Word processors to complex Content Management Systems for multiple purposes like content creation and editing, taking screenshots, creating diagrams and graphics, explaining codes, managing different versions of documents and creating videos. Some examples include:\n\n\n* Word Processors\n* Help Authoring Tools like Adobe Robohelp or Madcap Flare\n* Content Management Systems like WordPress\n* Wiki-based tools like Atlassian Confluence\n* DITA-based tools\n* Markdown tools like VS Code\n* Image editing tools like SnagIt, Figma, Microsoft Visio and Adobe Photoshop\n* Video creation tools like Techsmith Camtasia\n* Version Control tools like Tortoise SVN and GitHub\n* Bug Tracking tools like Jira\n* Project Management tools like Asana\n\n\nAs Technical Writing evolved as a practice, the scope increased, the requirements became more complex, and users became more demanding. Technical Writers need to consider several factors to decide the content layout, template, tooling, language, tone, and processes based on numerous factors like audience, geography, and medium, and include the principles of sustainability and scalability in their content strategy.\n\n\nHere is a quick shot at the latest trends in Technical Writing that are making waves in the industry and redefining how Technical Writers create content.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s New in Technical Writing\n-------------------------------\n\n\n### **1. Use of AI**\n\n\nEver since [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) introduced ChatGPT, every tech-savvy individual has tried to use it to simplify their job. Tech Writers are no different. They have realised that ChatGPT is a powerful tool, and if used intelligently, it can make content creation fast and efficient. The internet is flooded with blogs, articles, podcasts, and videos explaining how Tech Writers can use ChatGPT.\n\n\nCheck out our blog about how [Razorpay has used ChatGPT in its Technical Writing practice](https://razorpay.com/learn/using-chatgpt-for-technical-writing/) and improved efficiency.\n\n\n![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/ChatGPT-_Technical-Writing-770x515-1.png)[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) can be leveraged in the Technical Writing practice at various stages, such as:\n\n\n* Drafting\n* Editing\n* Formatting\n* Explaining Technical Concepts\n* Checking Consistency\n* Code Documentation\n* Creating Video Script\n\n\nA couple of organisations have incorporated AI-based search on their Docs platform.\n\n\nApart from ChatGPT, Tech Writers use tools like [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) to detect language and formatting errors, identify tone and make appropriate changes. Tech Writers are also exploring AI-generated images and diagrams.\n\n\n### **2. Automation**\n\n\nTech Writers today are adapting tools and systems to automate all that can be automated. Organisations, too, have realised the value and are willing to invest. For example:\n\n\n* Auto-detection of broken links on the web page before it goes into production.\n* Auto-generation of reports and dashboards to monitor the web page performance.\n* Auto-alignment of images and media components to avoid formatting errors.\n\n\n### **3. Cross-Functional Collaboration**\n\n\nCreating documents is now not just a tick mark in the Software Development Life Cycle. It is an essential deliverable, and all the teams have started collaborating to create accurate, complete, consumable content. Along with the Technical Writing team, Product, Engineering, Marketing, Design and Support teams are working cohesively to develop effective user and developer documentation.\n\n\n### **4. Focus on User Experience and Usability**\n\n\nTech Writers are now more user-centred in designing documents and documentation websites. Audience analysis and user research have become essential steps in creating documents. A document is not just content \u2013 design elements such as colours, fonts, spacing, usability such as placement of buttons and other UI elements are part of the overall content strategy.\n\n\n### **5. Media Rich Documentation and Interactive Content**\n\n\n![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/output-onlinegiftools-1.gif)Process video embedded on Razorpay Docs to explain how Razorpay Route works.\nTech Writers use high-resolution images, diagrams, screenshots, GIFs and videos to make the content more engaging. Product demos and Interactive Modals are embedded in Docs. API Playground makes developer documentation easier, where developers can test out APIs within the documentation. The idea is to provide multiple means to explain the concepts and make user self-serve easier.\n\n\nA link to Product Recommender is added on Razorpay Docs to [help users find Razorpay products](https://razorpay.com/docs/get-started/) as per their business needs.\n\n\n![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/ProductRecommender.png)A link to Product Recommender is added on Razorpay Docs to help users find Razorpay products as per their business needs.\n### **6. Data-driven Approach**\n\n\nTech Writers are using several means to understand their user behaviour, their usage pattern and the performance of their documents. SEO browser extensions and SEO tools like Google Analytics, [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) and [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/) are widely used to track the performance of documentation web pages. User feedback is collected using Surveys and tools like Hotjar. All of these data help Tech Writers better understand the users\u2019 pain points and tailor content as per their needs.\n\n\n### 7. Personalised Content\n\n\nPersonalised Content is also making its way into technical writing with content designed based on the user profile. Several content personalisation tools like [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm) and [Optin Monster](https://optinmonster.com/) are available. Brands like Amazon, Netflix and Spotify have adopted content personalisation and reaped the benefits. But these are e-commerce companies. The Content Strategists are evaluating and engineering ways to create personalised technical content.\n\n\nWhat Else?\n----------\n\n\nThese are golden times in Technical Writing. Organisations now realise the value of technical documentation. A well-written technical document can reduce costs and drive sales.\n\n\nTech Writing teams are building robust processes and using advanced tools to document, edit, maintain, measure and audit content. There is a shift in the **language and tone** of writing technical documents. The language is now more conversational, and the tone is more user-friendly. The **writing guidelines are now more flexible** to adapt to how the professional world has transformed over the years. The tech writers are now adding fun elements and more colours to make technical content interesting. Who says technical documents need to be boring? Here is a splendid example of how Slack has devised a unique way to write release notes.\n\n\n### References\n\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_writing>\n\n\n<https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-technical-writing-trends-predictions-samir-senapati/>\n\n\n<https://www.archbee.com/blog/6-new-trends-in-technical-writing-to-know-about>\n\n\n<https://www.searchenginejournal.com/content-writing-trends/479837/>\n\n\n<https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/definition/personalization>", "[August 29, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/empowering-coders-with-developer-documentation/)\n\n5 Mins Read\n\n\nBefore starting to write on Developer Documentation, I searched online for the definition of a Developer and found a couple of funny ones.\n\n\n###### *Developer:*\n\n\n* *An organism that converts coffee and pizza into code.*\n* *Someone who solves a problem you didn\u2019t know you had in a way you didn\u2019t understand.*\n\n\nBut jokes apart. Who is a developer? What are their traits?\n\n\nDevelopers are problem solvers. They analyse complex problems and deliver creative solutions. We have some fantastic software applications (including this one) thanks to them.\u00a0\n\n\nAs tech writers, one of the major audience segments we write for is the developer community. And writing for developers is slightly different than writing for other users. In this blog, we\u2019ll explore this thought and look at some tips to remember when creating content for this audience segment.\n\n\nDevelopers vs. Other Users\n==========================\n\n\nWhile both developers and other non-developer users, such as business decision-makers and non-technical users, seek information, they seek different types of information.\n\n\n**Content Requirements**\n------------------------\n\n\nDevelopers have specific documentation requirements that emphasise syntax, workflows, and customisation. Developers highly value clarity and conciseness and frequently skim for targeted information. Meanwhile, non-developers prefer ease of understanding, practical application, and a broader context. They want content with non-technical language, real-world examples, and relatable scenarios.\n\n\n**Documentation Type**\n----------------------\n\n\nDevelopers need multiple types of documentation:\n\n\n* Integration Documents: SDK Guides help developers integrate their systems with vendor systems.\n* Reference Materials: API Reference guides with exhaustive sample codes in multiple languages.\n* Troubleshooting Guides & Error Lists: Content that helps developers when they are mired in issues and need quick solutions to move ahead.\n\n\nOn the other hand, business decision-makers seek content that would help them learn about a product\u2019s features and benefits. The non-technical users want procedural instructions enabling them to take UI-based actions.\n\n\n**Technical Knowledge**\n-----------------------\n\n\nDevelopers are far more tech-savvy than other audience segments (business decision-makers and non-technical users). They can easily understand jargon and terms others find difficult to relate to. For example, JSON response is something developers understand. However, non-technical users would not be able to understand what that means readily.\n\n\n**Testing Tracks**\n------------------\n\n\nWhile business decision-makers seek product demos and non-technical users like to watch video materials to understand the software better, developers prefer to test the content by safely carrying out experiments in sandbox environments. Adding such playgrounds has proven to be a value addition for developers as they do not have to exert much effort in setting up complex systems just to try out APIs. For example, [Postman Workspace](https://www.postman.com/) is one such popular API playground.\n\n\nAuthoring Process\n=================\n\n\nTech Writing for Developers largely follows the same process as any other software documentation. We must research the audience, understand their needs and craft content that solves their queries.\n\n\n**1. Understanding the Audience**\n---------------------------------\n\n\n\n**2. Structuring the Developer Docs**\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nDevelopers have been viewing documentation from various sources \u2013 other product companies, your competitors and so on. Therefore, they come to the documentation expecting a certain structure. For example, an API Reference Guide should have the following structure for developers to find their way and start coding swiftly.\n\n\n* API Overview\n* API Authentication Method\n* Endpoints\n\t+ Overview\n\t+ Use Cases\n\t+ Request and Response Sample Codes\n\t+ Error Codes & Other Troubleshooting information\n\t+ Parameter Descriptions\n\t+ Links to API Playground\n\n\n![A screenshot of a Developer Documentation page (API page)](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-29-at-6.36.23-PM.png)A screenshot of a Developer Documentation page (API)\n**3. Simple Language, Clear Instructions**\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nOne should consider what kind of information developers prefer. Do they seek more context? Would more diagrams help? Developers do not like to read a lot of content; they appreciate brevity. But conciseness should not come at the cost of context. Hence, it is best to write simple, short instructions which convey the necessary information. Adding diagrams and other visual aids wherever needed enriches the content.\n\n\n**4. Internal Review**\n----------------------\n\n\nAfter the first draft is ready, writers should send it out with the relevant teams \u2013 product, tech and integrations/support- for internal review. The integrations/support team can do the UAT for the documentation. They can use the documentation as the base and conduct a short testing round to ensure the document accurately captures all the relevant details. Based on these findings, the writers can improve the content by adding more sample codes, use cases, etc.  \n\n\n\n\n**5. Go-Live and Feedback Collection**\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nOnce the documentation is published, it is not the end of the road. Writers should constantly measure the market feedback. Are developers responding well to the documentation, or are there any misses? What could be added/done better?\n\n\nAt Razorpay, we have integrated user feedback modules in the [API Documentation](https://razorpay.com/docs/api/) so that developers can swiftly provide suggestions and recommendations for documentation improvements.\n\n\n![Feedback Collection page to collect Developer feedback](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-29-at-6.35.55-PM.png)Feedback Collection Module in Razorpay Docs pages\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\n\nTech Writers can consider the above points to create technical documentation that empowers developers to engage with the software effectively. This will ensure a positive user experience and help build a loyal developer community.", "[August 29, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/evolution-in-technical-writing/)\n\n10 Mins Read\n\n\nFor over 5,600 years, writing has been more than ink on paper; it\u2019s a testament to humanity\u2019s unwavering spirit. Through the written word, we\u2019ve leapt across the chasms of time and distance, handed down wisdom from one generation to the next, and laid blueprints for the future. It has become our bridge to a deeper understanding \u2013 of the cosmos, our peers, and most importantly, our inner selves.\n\n\nThrough the power of the written word, we have transcended space and time. Conversations spanning generations have unfolded not in echoing chambers but across the pages of handwritten letters, books, and in today\u2019s digital realms. We\u2019ve felt the musings of ancient thinkers resonate within us, the passion of past poets ignite our emotions, and the groundbreaking visions of pioneers steering our collective journey forward.\n\n\nAt its core, writing is humanity\u2019s perpetual quest: to comprehend and connect, to probe and discover, and to envision and manifest. Far from just a communicative tool, it serves as a gateway to the cosmic wonders, the heartbeat of societies, and the depths of the human spirit.\n\n\nEarly Days of Writing\n---------------------\n\n\nThe roots of writing can be traced all the way back to ancient Sumerians who lived in what is now southern Iraq around 3200 BC. Before writing, societies would record their trades and resources using tokens and other mnemonic devices. However, as societies and trade flourished, the need for a more sophisticated system became paramount.\n\n\nEnter Cuneiform! One of the earliest writing forms, named for its wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets with a stylus. Using simple pictographs, it evolved into a more abstract system representing sounds and ideas. This was the case because language (and verbal communication generally) were fairly rudimentary at that time. Early on, cuneiform was written top to bottom, contrasting the familiar horizontal left-to-right flow in many modern languages. Eventually, its orientation shifted to left-to-right, with individual signs rotated to fit this new direction, which became the standard for cuneiform.\n\n\n![Ancient Sumerian Script](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-29-at-5.53.24-PM.png)Ancient Sumerian Script\nIn its early days, cuneiform was chiefly used for financial and administrative tasks. Sumerians meticulously noted transactions like goods exchanged, taxes settled, and allocated rations. For example, a clay tablet might record barley quantities received from a certain farmer or sheep sales from a particular marketplace.\n\n\nSuch meticulous documentation was vital for the governance of Sumerian city-states. With these detailed records, officials efficiently oversaw state storage facilities, religious temples, and other key establishments. This practice ensured a stable economy and empowered these city-states to command extensive resources and large communities.\n\n\nFrom humble beginnings as basic notches on clay tablets to track inventory, cuneiform blossomed into an essential medium for communication and governance. This pioneering script, coupled with the Sumerians\u2019 dedication to detailed record-keeping, laid the foundation for subsequent writing systems and the intricate administrative structures of future empires.\n\n\nThe Need for Simplicity in Communication\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nAs humanity navigated pivotal historical events such as the Industrial Revolution, World Wars, the Cold War, and significant advancements in science and technology, the demand for clear instructions became increasingly evident.\u00a0\n\n\nProviding instructions or manuals with products has ancient roots, but the kind of user manuals we associate with modern devices began to appear more systematically with the advent of complex machinery during the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n\nAs machinery and products became more intricate, the necessity for clear instructions on operation, maintenance, and safety became the need of the hour. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the proliferation of automobiles, household appliances, and other consumer goods, manufacturers recognized the importance of including user manuals not only for the proper use of the product but also to limit their own liability in case of misuse.\n\n\nUser manuals have always been our guiding stars, deciphering the mysteries of devices from different corners of the world. Have you ever noticed they come in an array of languages? That\u2019s the magic of globalization, ensuring gadgets find a home across varied linguistic landscapes. However, while this multilingual approach feels like second nature for pocket-sized wonders like calculators, it poses a Herculean challenge for certain industries.\n\n\nTake, for instance, aircraft manufacturing companies. Imagine trying to detail the intricacies of a machine composed of millions of parts, each sourced from global nooks and crannies and assembled at multiple junctures. A manual for such a marvel in just one language would be a tome, rivalling the length of classic epics! The vastness and complexity of documenting an aircraft\u2019s operation, maintenance, and safety in multiple languages were not feasible. At first, manufacturers would develop manuals only in the local language for the adoption of local mechanics and technicians working on the aircraft.\n\n\n![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-09-05-at-9.52.46-AM.png)Lockheed P38 aircraft used in WW2.\nAs aircraft soared from one corner of the world to another, they paused for essential touch-ups and fixes in diverse lands. But here\u2019s the twist: those intricate manuals, with their maze of technical jargon, often left mechanics and technicians scratching their heads! The world cried out for a universal manual language, something clear yet comprehensive. Answering the call, the [European Association of Aerospace Industries (AECMA)](https://uia.org/s/or/en/1100055977) stepped into the spotlight. By the swinging \u201970s and electric \u201980s, the pioneering guidelines for Simplified Technical English (STE) emerged. It wasn\u2019t just another standard; it was the dawn of the first-ever global lingua franca for technical documentation.\n\n\nWhy STE?\n--------\n\n\nAt its core, [STE](https://www.asd-ste100.org/) is a form of English language developed specifically for technical documentation. The idea is simple \u2013 break down the language to its simplest form and eliminate confusion as much as possible. In STE-approved documentation, each word can possess only a single meaning. You cannot use complex adjectives or words in your writing. Only the words that are approved in the STE dictionary can be used. Consider the adjective \u201cbig.\u201d While it might seem straightforward, it can be deemed ambiguous in certain contexts. Similarly, the word \u201cgrand\u201d can be misleading due to its multiple connotations. For clarity and precision, especially in technical documentation where ambiguity can lead to errors, it\u2019s recommended to use \u201clarge\u201d as a consistent descriptor.\n\n\nThe goal is to maintain word consistency across the documentation, fostering an intuitive understanding for the user regarding their subsequent actions. This ensures clarity and user-friendly navigation by adhering to specific guidelines, such as limiting sentences to a maximum of 20 words or prompting the user to execute just one action per sentence.\n\n\nIt does sound easier than it is. Breaking down complex actions into simple literature is no mean feat. You must understand the actions needed to be performed, visualize how you would break it down into simple text, and find the appropriate words for it.\n\n\n***That term was often misunderstood because people thought it meant easy English or baby English. But of course, when you try to write complex technical procedures in an easy way, that\u2019s a very difficult thing to do.***\n\n\n***\u2013 Duane Eilertson, Emeritus member of the STEMG***\n\n\nThe driving force behind its inception was evident. In a time marked by swift global growth and escalating technological complexities, the aviation realm sought an accurate, clear, universally understood language. This endeavour transcended mere linguistic concerns\u2014it was a pursuit of safety, uniformity, and efficiency in a sector where miscommunication could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Although STE diverges from traditional grammar norms, the aviation world holds it in high esteem, recognizing it as a paramount standard for documentation. The advent of STE underscored the aviation sector\u2019s progressive approach, showcasing its dedication to international safety norms. Indeed, STE\u2019s introduction remains a monumental moment in the annals of technical documentation.\n\n\nEvolving Epochs\n---------------\n\n\nIn the tapestry of our contemporary era, the intertwining threads of technology and the internet have woven patterns more intricate and expansive than anyone could have ever imagined. The omnipresence of the internet is awe-inspiring\u2014it has made its mark, infusing vitality into virtually every industry and sector. Imagine living in an age where electric cars, those marvels of modern engineering, receive over-the-air software patches that enhance their performance, agility, and dependability. Or, take a moment to ponder over the sheer volume of UPI transactions executed in India, amounting to tens of thousands daily. Such rapid technological strides necessitate that our documentation remains current and ahead of the curve, receiving regular updates to stay relevant.\n\n\nThe significance of robust documentation hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by corporate magnates. An increasing number of enterprises recognize and emphasize the indispensable role that clear and succinct guidelines play. For them, documentation isn\u2019t just an afterthought; it\u2019s a primary product, echoing the ethos and standards of the company. Developers and technical writers, in this renewed environment, collaborate more closely than ever, ensuring that the blueprint, functionality, and content align seamlessly, reflecting the innovation and vision of the company.\n\n\nUnderstanding one\u2019s primary audience and crafting documentation specifically tailored to their needs is paramount in today\u2019s rapidly evolving technological landscape. Tech giant Apple is a testament to this principle. With its detailed yet sleek developer documentation, Apple ensures that app creators can seamlessly integrate with the iOS ecosystem. They provide extensive resources, ranging from interface guidelines to in-depth programming instructions, all designed with the signature Apple aesthetic in mind.\n\n\nOn the other hand, Google also exemplifies excellence in user-focused documentation. Providing comprehensive guides for its range of products, from Android development to cloud integrations, Google\u2019s documentation is rich with examples, use-case scenarios, and interactive demos. Both novices and experts can easily navigate through the plethora of information. It\u2019s evident that both companies underscore the importance of an intuitive layout and clarity, making the intricate realm of technology more accessible to their vast user bases.\n\n\nWhen we at [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/docs/#home-payments) conceptualize our documentation, we adopt a similar [user-centric approach](https://razorpay.com/learn/tech-writers-guide-to-user-research/). Recognizing the diverse businesses and developers utilizing our platform, we prioritize clarity, simplicity, and actionable insights. For example, our integration guides are filled with code examples and provide context on why certain steps are essential, thus ensuring that even those new to the payment gateway ecosystem can comprehend and implement our solutions effectively. By consistently putting our audience at the forefront, we\u2019ve shaped our documentation to be more than just a manual\u2014it\u2019s a tool that empowers our users to harness the full potential of Razorpay\u2019s offerings.\n\n\nThrough the Looking Glass\n-------------------------\n\n\nIn the expansive timeline of human communication, the art and science of technical writing, while a relatively recent phenomenon, have witnessed substantial evolution. From the verbose manuals of early machinery to the interactive, hyperlinked digital documentation of today, the shift mirrors the broader technological transformation of our society. This evolution isn\u2019t just about changing mediums or formats; it reflects a deeper understanding of user behaviour, needs, and expectations.\n\n\nAt this juncture, it\u2019s essential to appreciate how far technical writing has come. Modern platforms, with their audience-centric documentation, exemplify the zenith of this journey while also offering glimpses into the potential directions the future might take. With the emergence of AI-driven content creation, augmented reality manuals, and even more personalized user experiences on the horizon, technical documentation is poised for yet another revolution. The underlying principle, however, remains steadfast: understanding the user\u2019s needs and communicating effectively. As we continue to innovate and evolve, this central tenet will anchor our strides, ensuring that technical writing remains an invaluable bridge between humans and the ever-advancing world of technology.", "[August 25, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/power-of-line-of-credit-explained/)\n\n13 Mins Read\n\n\n\n> Line of Credit is more than just a financial tool; it\u2019s a strategic enabler that empowers businesses to navigate financial challenges, pursue growth, and flourish in an unpredictable economic landscape.\n> \n> \n\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of business finance, adaptability is often the key to success.

Unlike a traditional loan, where you receive a lump sum that you repay in fixed instalments, it provides you the freedom to withdraw funds as needed, up to the limit.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis dynamic nature sets the stage for a range of financial manoeuvre that can make a significant difference in your business\u2019s journey.\n\n\nExploring the landscape of possibilities with line of credit\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the myriad ways in which a line of credit can reshape the trajectory of your business:\n\n\n1. **Seizing opportunities in real time**Imagine you run a [growing e-commerce business](https://razorpay.com/blog/e-commerce-business-razorpay-line-of-credit/), and suddenly, you secure the chance to partner with a prominent influencer for a high-impact marketing campaign. This collaboration promises exponential growth, but it requires an immediate injection of funds. Here\u2019s where lines of credit come into play. You can access the required funds swiftly, execute the campaign, and potentially reap substantial rewards.\n2. **Navigating cash flow challenges**Seasonal businesses often face cash flow challenges during off-peak periods. Consider a ski resort in the summer months \u2013 visitor numbers dwindle, but operational costs persist. A line of credit allows you to bridge these gaps seamlessly. You can cover essential expenses, maintain facilities, and ensure that you\u2019re prepared to shine when the peak season returns.\n3. **Fuelling innovation and expansion**Every business\u2019s growth journey involves expansion, diversification, or innovation. Imagine you\u2019re a tech startup with a groundbreaking idea, but the R&D phase requires significant investment. A line of credit empowers you to fund research, develop prototypes, and bring your innovation to market without compromising your current operations.\n4. **Mitigating unforeseen challenges**In business, curveballs are inevitable \u2013 whether it\u2019s a sudden equipment breakdown or a legal challenge. These unanticipated events can strain your resources and disrupt your plans. With a line of credit, you have a cushion that ensures you can address these challenges promptly and effectively.\n\n\nExamples of a line of credit in action\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nLet\u2019s consider a real-world line of credit example. [Nutrinda Food Sciences](https://grogobuy.com/) is a growing business in the F&B industry. When faced with irregular cash flow (cash shortages after managing all operational expenses was common), procuring raw materials in bulk posed a significant challenge. A line of credit gave Nutrinda a collateral-free, ready to use credit line that could be used during any shortfall situation for cash needs. It helped them maintain steady cash flow by providing access to funds when they needed it the most, round the clock\n\n\nUnlike traditional solutions that often involve cumbersome processes and delays, lines of credit usually offer a smooth, quick, and easy experience. The company effortlessly applied online and had their application processed within a few hours, streamlining the entire borrowing process for optimal convenience and efficiency.\n\n\nAs sales roll in, they repay the borrowed amount, and their line of credit is replenished, ready for future use, without a fresh application every time.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnraveling the credit line framework\n------------------------------------\n\n\nThe term \u201cline of credit\u201d is often interchangeably referred to as \u201ccredit line,\u201d and it signifies a strategic partnership between your business and a financial institution. This partnership involves understanding the terms, such as interest rates and repayment schedules, associated with your line of credit. While the terms might vary, the underlying principle remains consistent: the transformative power of a line of credit lies in its ability to adapt to your business\u2019s ever-changing needs.\n\n\nWhy is line of credit more than a loan?\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nA line of credit is more than a loan because it offers a level of flexibility, adaptability, and strategic value that goes beyond what traditional loans can provide. While loans and lines of credit both involve borrowing money, the key differences lie in how they are structured, accessed, and utilised. Here\u2019s why a line of credit stands out as more than just a loan:\n\n\n1. **Flexibility in borrowing:**Unlike a traditional loan, where you receive a lump sum of money upfront, a line of credit provides you with access to a pre-approved credit limit. This means you can withdraw funds as needed, up to that limit, whenever you require them. It\u2019s like having a financial safety net that you can dip into whenever opportunities or challenges arise. This flexibility ensures that you only borrow what you need, which can save you from paying unnecessary interest on unused funds.\n2. **Revolving nature:**One of the defining features of a line of credit is its revolving nature. As you repay the borrowed amount, the available credit is replenished, ready to be used again. This cycle of borrowing and repaying continues as long as your credit line remains open. In contrast, traditional loans are typically repaid over a fixed term, and once repaid, you need to reapply for a new loan if you require additional funds.\n3. **Paying interest only on what you use:**When you have a line of credit, you\u2019re only charged interest on the amount you\u2019ve actually withdrawn, not on the entire credit limit. This targeted interest payment can make lines of credit more cost-effective than traditional loans, where interest accrues on the entire borrowed amount from the beginning.\n4. **Agility in financial management:**A line of credit empowers you to navigate unexpected expenses or opportunities without the need to go through the loan application process every time. This agility is especially valuable for businesses that face irregular cash flows, sudden opportunities, or unforeseen challenges. It allows you to make timely decisions without being held back by financial constraints.\n5. **Customisable usage:**A line of credit offers the freedom to use funds for a wide range of purposes, from managing cash flow gaps and covering operating expenses to pursuing growth strategies, making investments, or even taking advantage of time-sensitive opportunities. This versatility makes it a tool that can adapt to your changing business needs.\n6. **Building credit and relationships:**Effectively managing a line of credit can positively impact your credit score and financial relationships. Consistently using and repaying your credit line demonstrates your ability to handle financial responsibilities, which can enhance your creditworthiness. Moreover, maintaining a positive relationship with your lender can lead to improved terms, increased credit limits, and access to additional financial products.\n\n\n\n> In essence, a line of credit transcends the boundaries of a traditional loan by providing a dynamic, responsive, and adaptable financial solution. It\u2019s not just about receiving a lump sum of money; it\u2019s about gaining access to a strategic tool that empowers you to seize opportunities, overcome challenges, and navigate your financial journey with agility and confidence.\n> \n> \n\n\nRisks of line of credit for businesses\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nWhile a line of credit offers numerous advantages for businesses, it\u2019s important to recognise that there are also risks associated with its use. Being aware of these risks allows businesses to make informed decisions and develop strategies to mitigate potential drawbacks. Here are some of the key risks of using a line of credit for businesses:\n\n\n**1. Over-borrowing:**\n\n\nOne of the primary risks with a line of credit is the temptation to borrow more than you can reasonably repay. The flexibility to access funds can lead to over-borrowing, which can strain your cash flow and potentially lead to financial instability. It\u2019s crucial to have a well-defined plan for how the borrowed funds will be used and repaid to avoid falling into a cycle of debt.\n\n\n**2. Interest costs:**\n\n\nWhile lines of credit offer flexibility, they also come with interest costs. Borrowing and maintaining a balance on your line of credit can result in significant interest payments over time. High interest rates or failure to manage interest costs effectively can impact your profitability and overall financial health.\n\n\n**3. Fluctuating interest rates:**\n\n\nMany lines of credit come with variable interest rates, which means that the interest you pay can change based on market conditions. While variable rates can sometimes be lower initially, they also carry the risk of increasing over time, potentially leading to higher borrowing costs than anticipated.\n\n\n**4. Collateral requirements:**\n\n\nThere are two types of lines of credit: secured and unsecured. Secured lines of credit may require businesses to pledge assets or collateral as security for the credit. This means that if the business is unable to repay the borrowed amount, the lender can seize the collateral. Defaulting on a secured line of credit could lead to the loss of valuable assets, which can have serious consequences for the business\u2019s operations and financial stability.\n\n\n**5. Impact on credit score:**\n\n\nUsing a line of credit irresponsibly or missing payments can negatively impact your business\u2019s credit score. A lower credit score can make it more difficult to secure favourable terms on future loans or credit lines and may affect your overall financial reputation.\n\n\n**6. Dependency on borrowed funds:**\n\n\nWhile a line of credit can be a valuable tool for managing cash flow, excessive reliance on borrowed funds might indicate underlying financial issues. If a business consistently relies on a line of credit to cover basic operating expenses, it could be a sign of a larger financial problem that needs to be addressed.\n\n\n**7. Limited access during economic downturns:**\n\n\nDuring economic downturns or financial crises, lenders might reduce or revoke existing lines of credit as a risk management measure. This can leave businesses with reduced access to funds precisely when they need it the most, potentially causing operational challenges.\n\n\n**8. Complexity of terms:**\n\n\nLines of credit often come with terms and conditions that need to be carefully understood. Failure to comprehend these terms, including interest calculations, repayment schedules, and fees, can lead to misunderstandings, unexpected costs, and financial strain.\n\n\n**9. Potential impact on relationships:**\n\n\nDefaulting on a line of credit can strain relationships with lenders and harm your business\u2019s reputation within the financial community. Maintaining a positive relationship with your lender is crucial, and it requires responsible management of your credit line.\n\n\nHow to apply for a line of credit?\n----------------------------------\n\n\nHere\u2019s a general guide on how to apply for a business line of credit:\n\n\n**1. Assess your business\u2019s financial health:**\n\n\nBefore applying for a line of credit, evaluate your business\u2019s financial situation. This includes reviewing your credit score, cash flow projections, financial statements, and any outstanding debts. Lenders will consider these factors to assess your creditworthiness.\n\n\n**2. Choose the right lender:**\n\n\nResearch different lenders to find the one that offers terms, rates, and features that align with your business\u2019s needs. This can include traditional banks, credit unions, online lenders, and other financial institutions. Consider factors such as interest rates, credit limit, fees, and repayment terms.\n\n\nFor example, Razorpay Line of Credit is a cutting-edge financing option designed to empower businesses with flexible funding. With Razorpay Line of Credit, businesses gain access to on-demand capital (up top Rs. 50 lakhs), without any collateral or pre-closure fee.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**3. Gather required documents:**\n\n\nLenders typically require specific documentation to process your line of credit application. Common documents include business financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement), personal and business tax returns, business plan, legal documents (business licenses, articles of incorporation), and bank statements.\n\n\n**4. Apply online**\n\n\nMost lenders offer a seamless [online application](https://razorpay.com/x/line-of-credit/?utm_source=Content&utm_medium=Learn&utm_campaign=More+Than+a+Loan%3A+The+Transformative+Power+of+Line+of+Credit+Explained#applicaiton-steps) process for lines of credit. All you need to do is visit the lenders website and complete the application process.\n\n\n**5. Await approval and terms offer:**\n\n\nOnce your application is submitted, the lender will review it and assess your creditworthiness. If approved, you\u2019ll receive an offer outlining the terms of the line of credit, including the credit limit, interest rate, repayment terms, and any associated fees.\n\n\n**6. Review and accept the offer:**\n\n\nCarefully review the terms offered by the lender. Pay close attention to the interest rate, repayment schedule, and any fees associated with the line of credit. If the terms align with your business\u2019s needs and financial capabilities, accept the offer.\n\n\nHow to withdraw funds from line of credit?\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nWithdrawing funds from a line of credit is a simple process. Most lenders offer multiple methods for accessing your funds. You can use online banking to transfer the desired amount from your line of credit to your business account, providing instant access. Alternatively, if your line of credit includes a debit card, you can make purchases or withdraw cash at ATMs. Some lenders also issue checks linked to your line of credit, allowing you to write checks for specific amounts. Just ensure you don\u2019t exceed your available credit limit.\n\n\nKey takeaways\n-------------\n\n\nHere are the 5 most important key takeaways from the provided text:\n\n\n1. **Strategic empowerment:** A line of credit is not just a financial tool; it\u2019s a strategic enabler for businesses. It empowers them to navigate financial challenges, seize growth opportunities, and thrive in an unpredictable economic environment.\n2. **Adaptability for success:** In the ever-evolving world of business finance, adaptability is a key factor for success. A line of credit offers businesses the flexibility to respond swiftly to opportunities, such as expansion, bulk purchases, or technology investments, even when their cash flow isn\u2019t aligned.\n3. **Dynamic nature of a line of credit:** A line of credit goes beyond conventional loans, offering businesses the ability to access funds up to a predetermined credit limit. This dynamic nature allows for a range of strategic decision making that can positively impact a business\u2019s journey.\n4. **Wide range of possibilities:** A line of credit opens up numerous possibilities for businesses, such as seizing real-time opportunities, overcoming cash flow challenges, fuelling innovation, and mitigating unforeseen obstacles. It acts as a safety net that ensures businesses can navigate various scenarios effectively.\n5. **Adaptive financial partner:** A line of credit is more than just a loan due to its flexibility, revolving nature, cost-effectiveness, agility, versatility, and its potential to improve credit and relationships. It adapts to the changing needs of a business, acting as a financial partner that supports growth, resilience, and confidence.", "[August 24, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/approaches-of-working-capital-management/)\n\n7 Mins Read\n\n\nIn the realm of financial management, the effective management and approaches of [working capital](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/working-capital-loan-small-business/) are essential aspects that directly impact a company\u2019s financial health. Businesses need to strike a balance between their short-term assets and liabilities to ensure smooth operations and sustained growth.\n\n\nIn this article, we will delve into the various approaches to working capital management that businesses can employ to optimise their cash flow and bolster their financial stability.\n\n\nUnderstanding working capital:\n------------------------------\n\n\nBefore we explore the approaches to working capital management, let\u2019s [understand the concept of working capital for businesses](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/working-capital/). Working capital refers to the funds available for a company\u2019s day-to-day operations, including covering operational expenses, managing inventory, and meeting short-term obligations. Effectively managing working capital is crucial to avoiding liquidity issues and maintaining a robust financial position.\n\n\nPS: If you\u2019re looking for working capital loans, click on the CTA below:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Let\u2019s illustrate this with an example:**\n\n\nImagine a retail company, ABC Electronics, that sells electronic gadgets. To operate smoothly, ABC Electronics needs to maintain a balance between its current assets and current liabilities. Current assets include cash, inventory, and accounts receivable, while current liabilities encompass accounts payable and short-term debt.\n\n\nIf ABC Electronics doesn\u2019t manage its working capital effectively, it might face challenges. For instance, if it overstocks inventory, a significant portion of its funds could be tied up in products that aren\u2019t selling quickly. This could lead to cash flow issues, as the company would struggle to pay its suppliers or meet other short-term obligations.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if ABC Electronics tightly manages its working capital, it could strategically adjust its inventory levels based on demand, negotiate favourable terms with suppliers, and ensure that accounts receivable are collected promptly. This approach would free up cash that could be used for expansion, investing in new technologies, or handling unexpected expenses.\n\n\nApproaches of working capital management:\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nWorking capital management can be approached through three distinct strategies: conservative, aggressive, and moderate. Each approach offers a unique perspective on balancing operational liquidity and financial efficiency. Let\u2019s delve deeper:\n\n\n### Conservative approaches of working capital:\n\n\nConservative approaches of working capital management prioritise maintaining higher levels of working capital to ensure a safety net for unforeseen events. This involves holding larger inventories and keeping surplus cash on hand. While it safeguards the company against sudden financial shocks, it may also tie up capital that could otherwise be invested in growth opportunities.\n\n\n### Aggressive approaches of working capital:\n\n\nIn contrast, aggressive approaches of working capital management focus on minimising the amount of working capital tied up in the business. This involves efficient inventory management, prompt receivables collection, and strategic payables management. While it optimises resource utilisation, it may expose the company to risks associated with inadequate liquidity.\n\n\n### Moderate approaches of working capital:\n\n\nA middle ground between the conservative and aggressive approaches, moderate approaches of working capital management seek to balance risk and efficiency. They aim to maintain a reasonable level of working capital while also exploring opportunities for growth and investment. This approach requires careful monitoring of cash flow patterns and a proactive stance toward adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n\nApproaches of working capital: Example\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nLet\u2019s consider how a retail company might utilise all three approaches of working capital management.\n\n\n**Company: XYZ Retail**\n\n\nXYZ Retail is a chain of electronics stores that sells a wide range of electronic gadgets and appliances.\n\n\n### **Conservative approach of working capital management:**\n\n\nIn the conservative approach of working capital management, XYZ Retail prioritises stability and preparedness for unforeseen events.\n\n\n* **Inventory management:** The company maintains a slightly higher level of inventory than immediate demand requires. This ensures that they have products in stock to meet customer needs, even during supply chain disruptions.\n* **Receivables collection:** XYZ Retail maintains a balanced approach to receivables collection. They incentivise early payments from customers through discounts while maintaining positive customer relationships.\n* **Payables management:** The company pays suppliers on time while negotiating favourable terms where possible to maintain good relationships.\n\n\n\n> Suggestion: Given the retail industry\u2019s volatility and seasonality, a slightly conservative approach to working capital management is suggested. This ensures that the company has sufficient inventory to meet customer demands and navigate unexpected disruptions.\n> \n> \n\n\n### **Aggressive approach of working capital management:**\n\n\nIn certain situations, XYZ Retail might adopt an aggressive approach to capitalise on specific opportunities.\n\n\n* **Inventory management:** During peak shopping seasons, XYZ Retail adopts an aggressive inventory management approach. They keep only the essentials in stock to maximise their cash flow during high-demand periods.\n* **Receivables collection:** During promotional events, XYZ Retail becomes more proactive in collecting payments from customers to maintain healthy cash flow.\n* **Payables management:** The company extends payment periods slightly to manage cash flow more effectively, particularly when they anticipate strong sales in the near future.\n\n\n\n> Suggestion: An aggressive approach might be suitable during periods of high demand, such as holiday seasons or special sales events. However, this should be managed carefully to avoid customer dissatisfaction and supply chain disruptions.\n> \n> \n\n\n### **Moderate approach of working capital management:**\n\n\nIn day-to-day operations, XYZ Retail follows a moderate approach to working capital management.\n\n\n* **Inventory management:** The company maintains a balance between stocking essential products and avoiding excess inventory.\n* **Receivables collection:** XYZ Retail maintains its regular receivables collection strategy, considering both cash flow and customer relations.\n* **Payables management:** The company manages payables strategically, optimising supplier relationships while honouring payment commitments.\n* **Investment and growth:** XYZ Retail allocates a portion of its capital to explore new product lines and store expansion opportunities.\n* **Cash flow monitoring:** The company consistently monitors its cash flow patterns and adjusts strategies accordingly.\n\n\n\n> Suggestion: The moderate approach is generally suggested for day-to-day operations. It allows XYZ Retail to maintain financial stability while also pursuing growth opportunities and being prepared for unforeseen events.\n> \n> \n\n\n### Approaches of working capital management: the fine balance\n\n\n1. 1. **Inventory management strategies:**  \n\t\n\tEfficient inventory management is crucial for maintaining optimal working capital. Adopting techniques like the [Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicorderquantity.asp) and [Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory systems](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/inventory-management/just-in-time-inventory.shtml) can help in minimising excess inventory and associated holding costs.\n\t2. **Accounts receivable and payable management:**  \n\t\n\tStreamlining the accounts receivable process by offering discounts for early payments or implementing stricter credit policies can accelerate cash inflows. On the payables side, negotiating favourable terms with suppliers can extend payment deadlines without affecting relationships.\n\t3. **Cash flow forecasting:**  \n\t\n\tImplementing robust cash flow forecasting models helps in predicting cash requirements accurately. This enables businesses to make informed decisions regarding their working capital needs and plan for potential shortfalls or surpluses.\n\t4. **Short-term financing options:**  \n\t\n\tExploring short-term financing options like [lines of credit](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/introducing-razorpay-line-of-credit/) or invoice financing can provide a cushion during periods of low liquidity. However, these should be managed judiciously to avoid over-dependence and increased financial obligations.If you\u2019re looking for short-term financing options, such as line of credit, head here \ud83d\udc47\n\n\n\nTo conclude\u2026\n------------\n\n\nWorking capital management is a dynamic process that requires a deep understanding of a company\u2019s financial landscape and its unique operational requirements. By adopting appropriate approaches to working capital management, businesses can ensure a healthy cash flow, mitigate financial risks, and position themselves for sustainable growth. Whether through a conservative, aggressive, or moderate approach, the key lies in striking the right balance between liquidity, efficiency, and profitability. Remember, staying attuned to market trends and maintaining flexibility in strategies are essential for effective working capital management.\n\n\nAs you embark on your journey to master working capital management, keep in mind the diverse strategies discussed here.

It is calculated by dividing the company\u2019s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expense.\n\n\nA high ICR indicates that a company has a healthy financial position and is able to easily meet its interest obligations. A low ICR, on the other hand, may be a sign of financial difficulty.\n\n\nFinancial analysts and investors use the interest coverage ratio to understand a company\u2019s ability to pay off the accumulated interest on debt. It is a powerful indicator of a company\u2019s financial health and current debt burden.\n\n\nImportance of ICR in Business\n-----------------------------\n\n\nWhy do businesses and lenders calculate the interest coverage ratio?\n\n\n**Creditworthiness:**Companies borrow money from various financial institutions and other sources. These lenders need assurance that they\u2019ll receive their payments with interest regularly. The ICR helps lenders understand whether the business will be able to make interest payments or not.\n\n\n**Financial health:** Interest coverage ratio can be assessed to check the short-term financial health of a company.\u00a0A consistently dropping ICR means that the business\u2019s earnings are falling while its debt is increasing.\n\n\n**Business trends:** Interest coverage ratio of previous years can be used for trend analysis to determine a company\u2019s ability to repay interest.\u00a0\n\n\n**Interest Coverage Ratio Formula**\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nThe formula for calculating ICR is as follows:\u00a0\n\n\n`Interest coverage ratio = Earnings before interest and taxes / interest expense`\n\n\n* EBIT = Business\u2019s operating profit\n* Interest Expense = Total interest payable on all borrowings\n\n\nInterpreting Interest Coverage Ratio\n------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n| Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) | Interpretation |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 or less | The company is struggling to meet its interest obligations and may be at risk of defaulting on its loans. |\n| 1.5 to 2 | The company is in a healthy financial position and has sufficient funds to meet its interest obligations. |\n| 2 or more | The company is in a very strong financial position and has more than enough funds to meet its interest obligations. |\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s check how the interest coverage ratio is interpreted by financial analysts and investors:\u00a0\n\n\n* **High Interest Coverage Ratio**\n\n\nA high ICR value indicates that a company is financially strong and has sufficient funds to pay its interest obligations. An ICR of 1 indicates that the company needs to use its entire earnings to pay its interest on time. For a company to have sufficient earnings for interest payments, it needs to have an ICR of 1.5 or more.\n\n\n* **Low-Interest Coverage Ratio**\n\n\nA low-interest coverage ratio indicates that a company may not be able to able to manage its debts effectively. In other words, the company will need to use liquidate its assets to repay its loans.\n\n\nRemember that if you come across an organisation that consistently exhibits a low-interest coverage ratio, it indicates the organisation is incapable of repayment.\n\n\n**Types of Interest Coverage Ratios**\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nThere are several ways to calculate the ICR of a company. Besides using EBIT, you can use other metrics like EBITDA, EBIAT, fixed charge and EBITDA minus capex.\n\n\n* **EBITDA Interest Coverage Ratio**\n\n\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) coverage ratio helps determine how many times EBITDA can service the interest expense which is due.\u00a0\n\n\n* **EBITDA Less Capex Interest Coverage Ratio**\n\n\nYou can use this interest coverage ratio to check the number of times EBITDA can be used to service the interest expense after the deduction of capex.\u00a0\n\n\n* **EBIAT Interest Coverage Ratio**\n\n\nInstead of using EBIT, you use earnings before interest after taxes. As companies must pay taxes, it provides a more realistic picture of a company\u2019s capacity to pay interest on loans.\n\n\n* **Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR)**\n\n\nFCCR measures the ability of a company to pay all of its short-term financial requirements. It can be adjusted to include rent expenses as well.\u00a0\n\n\nLimitations of Interest Coverage Ratio\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nWhile the ICR is a robust metric to determine creditworthiness and short-term financial health, there are a few limitations that must be kept in mind.\n\n\n* **It only considers a company\u2019s current interest expenses.**\u00a0The ICR does not take into account future interest expenses, which could increase if the company takes on more debt or if interest rates rise.\n* **It does not consider a company\u2019s cash flow.**\u00a0The ICR only considers a company\u2019s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which is not always a good indicator of a company\u2019s cash flow. A company with a high ICR could still have difficulty meeting its interest obligations if it does not have enough cash flow.\n* **It is not adjusted for seasonality.**\u00a0The ICR can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in a company\u2019s revenue and expenses. For example, a company that sells seasonal products may have a lower ICR in the off-season than in the peak season.\n* **It can be manipulated by companies.** Companies can manipulate their ICR by taking on non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortisation. This can make the ICR look better than it actually is.\n\n\nDespite these limitations, the ICR is a useful metric for assessing a company\u2019s ability to pay its interest expenses. However, it should be used in conjunction with other financial metrics to get a more complete picture of a company\u2019s financial health.\n\n\n\nHere are some other accounting ratios that can be used to assess a company\u2019s financial health:\n\n\n* [Debt to equity ratio](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/debt-to-equity-ratio-explained/)\n* Debt to EBITDA ratio\n* Cash flow to debt ratio\n* EBITDA margin\n* Return on equity (ROE)\n\n\n#### **Better Financial Management with RazorpayX**\n\n\nRazorpayX is helping India\u2019s top businesses digitise their banking functions.

There have been instances when lenders have asked for an ICR of 3. The ideal ICR depends greatly on the particular sector. \n\n\n\n\n\n### How to improve the interest coverage ratio?\n\n\n\nThere are mainly two ways by which you can increase the ICR of your company. The first way is by increasing the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) which can be achieved once revenue is increased. The second way is by decreasing finance costs or interest expenses. This can be done through debt refinancing.\n\n\n\n\n\n### How to get the details of a company to calculate the interest coverage ratio?\n\n\n\nListed companies are required to publish their financial statements after every financial quarter and year. If you\u2019re interested to check a company\u2019s ICR, you can go through these financial statements to get the details for calculating this ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Is there any limitation to the interest coverage ratio?\n\n\n\nUsing ICR alone will not help you compare two companies reliably especially if they belong to two different industries. Moreover, while calculating the interest coverage ratio, a company may not include all types of debt which might generate a skewed result. \n\n\n\n\n\n### What are the warnings signs of a declining interest coverage ratio?\n\n\n\nThe warning signs of a declining interest coverage ratio include decreased operating income, increased debt, increased interest expense, reduced profitability and lower credit ratings.", "[August 23, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/put-call-ratio/)\n\n6 Mins Read\n\n\nOptions trading is one of the riskiest endeavours for an investor to embark on.

If the price of the asset decline below the strike price, the holder of the put option can choose to exercise his option and sell the asset at a higher strike price.\u00a0\n\n\n### **Call Option Explained**\n\n\nA call option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) within a specific period. \n\n\nCall options are used to profit from anticipated price increases in the underlying asset. If the asset\u2019s price rises above the strike price, the call option holder can exercise the option and purchase the asset at the lower strike price, enabling them to potentially profit from the price difference.\n\n\nBoth put and call options are tradable financial instruments used in options trading, allowing investors to speculate on price movements, hedge against risks, or generate potential profits in various market conditions.\n\n\n\n### Put Option vs Call Option\n\n\n\n\n| Feature | Put Option | Call Option |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Definition | Gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specified price on or before a specified date. | Gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specified price on or before a specified date. |\n| Strike price | The price at which the holder can buy or sell the asset. | The price at which the holder can buy or sell the asset. |\n| Premium | The price paid for the option. | The price paid for the option. |\n| Max loss | Limited to the premium paid. | Unlimited if the price of the asset rises above the strike price. |\n| Max profit | Unlimited if the price of the asset falls below the strike price. | Limited to the difference between the strike price and the market price of the asset. |\n| Best used when | You believe the price of the asset will fall. | You believe the price of the asset will rise. |\n\n\n**How is Put Call Ratio Calculated?**\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nPut Call Ratio can be calculated two ways:\u00a0\n\n\n1. **From Options Trading Volumes:** PCR can be calculated using the volumes of options trading. The total sum of all put options traded divided by the total number of call options traded during a specific period gives you the PCR. This gives insight into the sentiment of actively trading investors in the market.\n2. **Based on Open Interest:** \u201cOpen Interest\u201d refers to the number of options contracts that have not been exercised. PCR can also be calculated based on the total number of unexpired put options divided by the total number of outstanding call options. This approach gives insight into the sentiments of traders who have already established positions in the market and can indicate the potential of future market trends.\n\n\n**How to Analyse PCR (Put Call Ratio)?**\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nA PCR above 1 means there are more puts than calls. When an investor buys a put option, they are betting that the price of the asset will decrease in the future. This is because the put option gives the investor the right to sell the asset at a predetermined price, even if the market price of the asset has fallen.\u00a0\n\n\nThus, a PCR above 1 means more investors are betting against the market and expect the asset to drop.\n\n\nPCR of exactly 1 means the volume of puts traded is equal to volume of calls traded \u2013 this is unrealistic since there will never be a situation where puts are exactly equal to calls.\n\n\nFinally, a PCR that is below 1 indicates more calls being traded than puts \u2013 meaning more investors want to bet for the market and expect the asset price to rise in the future.\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the put-call ratio is best used in conjunction with other technical indicators, market news, and fundamental analysis to form a comprehensive understanding of market sentiment and potential trends.\n\n\n**Importance of Put Call Ratio**\n--------------------------------\n\n\n* A put-call ratio provides a snapshot of market sentiment and helps investors gauge whether the overall market sentiment is bullish or bearish.\n* The put-call ratio serves as a valuable contrarian indicator, as extreme readings can suggest potential market reversals when sentiment reaches extremes.\n* By monitoring changes in the put-call ratio, investors can gain insights into shifts in market expectations and adjust their trading strategies accordingly.\n* The put-call ratio is a widely watched metric that helps traders and analysts assess the balance between hedging and speculation in the options market, offering valuable clues about future market movements.\n\n\nInvestments and Financial Management\n------------------------------------\n\n\nMaking wise investment decisions is very important in a fast-paced, turbulent market, for individuals as well as businesses. Wise investment decisions mean financial stability and a passive source of income.\n\n\nA strong, well-diversified portfolio helps individuals and businesses spread investments across different assets, reducing the risk of losses and increasing the potential for returns.\n\n\nOne way to make time for investments, growth and money management is to automate business finances.\u00a0\n\n\nRazorpayX offers automation for your business\u2019s manual financial operations, making finances smooth and effortless. Here are the following beneficial features that you can unlock by opting for RazorpayX:\u00a0\n\n\n* Payroll management\n* Vendor management\n* Corporate credit cards\n* Payouts\n* Coordinating with CA and finance teams\n* OTP sharing\n\n\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is the put-call ratio and how is it calculated?\n\n\n\nThe put-call ratio is a measure of market sentiment in options trading. It is calculated by dividing the total volume or open interest of traded put options by the total volume or open interest of traded call options during a specific period.\n\n\n\n\n\n### How can the put-call ratio be used to analyze market sentiment?\n\n\n\nThe put-call ratio provides insights into whether market sentiment is bullish or bearish. A ratio above 1 indicates a higher demand for put options, suggesting a bearish sentiment. Conversely, a ratio below 1 suggests a higher demand for call options, indicating a bullish sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### What are the implications of a high put-call ratio?\n\n\n\nA high put-call ratio suggests a bearish sentiment in the market. It indicates that more investors are buying put options, potentially as a hedge against anticipated market declines. A higher ratio can be seen as a signal of increased caution or pessimism among traders.\n\n\n\n\n\n### How can traders utilize the put-call ratio in their decision-making process?\n\n\n\nTraders can use the put-call ratio as a contrarian indicator. When the ratio reaches extreme levels, it may signal a potential market reversal. For example, a very high put-call ratio could suggest that market sentiment has become overly bearish, indicating a possible buying opportunity. However, it is important to consider the ratio alongside other technical indicators and market analysis for comprehensive decision-making.", "[August 22, 2023](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/compensation-management/)\n\n8 Mins Read\n\n\nCompensation management is one of the primary functions of HR, as it plays a crucial role in attracting and retaining top talent.\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n* [What is compensation management?](#What-is-compensation-management \"What is compensation management?\")\n* [Key factors affecting compensation management](#Key-factors-affecting-compensation-management \"Key factors affecting compensation management\")\n* [Different types of compensation](#Different-types-of-compensation \"Different types of compensation\u00a0\")\n\t+ [Direct Compensation](#Direct-Compensation \"Direct Compensation\")\n\t+ [Indirect Compensation](#Indirect-Compensation \"Indirect Compensation\")\n* [Importance of compensation management for HR Leaders](#Importance-of-compensation-management-for-HR-Leaders \"Importance of compensation management for HR Leaders\")\n* [How is compensation management determined?](#How-is-compensation-management-determined \"How is compensation management determined?\")\n* [Things to be considered by HR Leaders to ensure effective compensation management](#Things-to-be-considered-by-HR-Leaders-to-ensure-effective-compensation-management \"Things to be considered by HR Leaders to ensure effective compensation management\")\n* [Benefits of Compensation Management](#Benefits-of-Compensation-Management \"Benefits of Compensation Management\")\n* [Compensation Management Software \u2013 RazorpayX Payroll](#Compensation-Management-Software-RazorpayX-Payroll \"Compensation Management Software \u2013 RazorpayX Payroll\")\n\nWhat is compensation management?\n--------------------------------\n\n\nIt is managing and determining an employer\u2019s compensation to the employees in return for their work.\n\n\nCompensation management involves managing, analysing, and determining the salary, benefits, and incentives paid to the employees. Compensation management plays a crucial role in attracting and retaining top talent. It includes monetary as well as non-monetary benefits. It also increases employee productivity and reduces employee turnover.\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, it ensures that every employee gets paid a fair wage based on industry standards, work experience, company budget, etc.\n\n\nKey factors affecting compensation management\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nHere\u2019s a list of key factors that affect compensation management. We have discussed each factor in detail in the next section.\n\n\n* Productivity of workers\n* Ability to pay\n* Government policies\n* Labour unions\n* Cost of living\n* Demand and supply of labour\n* Industry standards\n\n\n**![compensation management](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2022/11/Insert-Image-1-1024x536.png)**\n\n\n* **Productivity of workers**\u2013 Productivity-based compensation helps derive the best results. The higher the productivity of employees, the more should be the compensation.\n* **Ability to pay**\u2013 If your company has high profitability, you can pay better compensation and [retain your employees](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/employee-retention-strategies/) and vice versa.\n* **Government Policies**\u2013 Government also has certain policies to protect employee interests. The employer has to pay the employees as per governmental regulations and provide benefits such as PF, medical insurance, [gratuity](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/what-is-gratuity/), and pension.\n* **Labour Unions**\u2013 They also play an essential role in ensuring employees get a fair wage. They fight with the employers for the employee\u2019s rights and wage revision.\n* **Cost of Living**\u2013 Cost of living also influences compensation to a large extent. An employee based in a city with a high cost of living needs a higher salary and vice versa.\n* **Demand and Supply of Labour**\u2013 It is one of the most important factors that affect the compensation of employees. If the demand is more than the supply, the compensation will be higher.\n* **Industry Standards**\u2013 No employee would like to join a company whose compensation is below the industry standards. Therefore you need to analyse the standard market rates of different roles and pay your employees accordingly.\n\n\nDifferent types of compensation\n-------------------------------\n\n\nThe types of compensation are broadly classified into direct compensation and indirect compensation. Let us look at them in detail.\u00a0\n\n\n### Direct Compensation\n\n\nIt is the monetary benefits provided by the employer to the employees.\n\n\n* **Hourly pay**\u2013 Hourly pay is the salary paid for each hour of work that the employee does.\n* **Salary**\u2013 Salary is the fixed monthly amount that the employer pays to the employee in cash.\n* **Commission**\u2013 A monetary reward that is paid based on the performance of an individual. It is generally provided in the case of sales jobs as a fixed percentage.\n* **Bonus**\u2013 A bonus is a monetary incentive paid to employees for their good performance. It is paid over and above the employee\u2019s basic salary.\n\n\n[Suggested Read: [Salary Breakup \u2013 Salary Structure, Format, Calculation & More](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/salary-breakup-structure-format/)]\n\n\n### Indirect Compensation\n\n\nIndirect compensation refers to non-monetary benefits like paid holidays, insurance, and retirement benefits.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Insurance**\u2013 Employers generally provide employees with medical insurance to ensure good health of their employees. If you are an early-stage startup facing difficulties getting employee insurance, check out [RazorpayX Payroll](https://razorpay.com/group-health-insurance/?r=blog_cta_Compensation_Management). It provides group insurance packages to teams as small as 2!\n* **Paid holidays**\u2013\u00a0 Paid holidays are provided to help employees maintain a work-life balance.\n* **ESOPs**\u2013 Sometimes, companies also provide their employees with their shares at a discounted price, offering them an additional opportunity to earn.\n\n\n[Suggested Read: [The Complete Guide to ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans)](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/esop-complete-guide/)]\n\n\n* **Retirement Benefits**\u2013 Retirement benefits include gratuity, pension, general provident fund, [leave encashment](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/leave-encashment-calculation/), etc.\n* **Leave travel allowance**\u2013 LTA or leave travel allowance is the non-monetary benefit provided by the employer to the employee where the employer covers the employee\u2019s travel expenses.\n* **Relocation expenses**\u2013 Relocation expenses are the benefits the employer provides in case the job requires relocation to a different city.\n\n\nImportance of compensation management for HR Leaders\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhile the list of reasons why you should focus on compensation management is rather long, here are a few main reasons-\n\n\n* **Helps Plan Your Budget**\u2013 Employee salaries are the highest cost for any startup. Compensation management helps determine the costs beforehand and plan the budget accordingly. It also helps plan increments and other benefits based on industry standards.\n* **Helps Motivate Employee**s- Compensation is the key factor influencing an employee\u2019s productivity. A well-paid employee is more likely to work hard for your company and vice versa.\n* **Reduces Employee Turnover**\u2013 Giving adequate monetary and non-monetary benefits helps increase job satisfaction and reduce the rate of employee turnover.\n* **Attracts Best Talent**\u2013 It not only prevents employees from switching jobs but also helps attract top talent. The best talent always looks for a company with a competitive salary and benefits like insurance, paid time off, leave allowance, [flexible benefits](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/flexible-benefit-plan-fbp-component/), etc.\n\n\nThe huge number of employees makes manual compensation management tiresome and error-prone. The best way to deal with the payroll of a huge number of employees is to use payroll processing software like [RazorpayX Payroll](https://razorpay.com/payroll/?r=blog_cta_Compensation_Management).\u00a0\n\n\n\nHow is compensation management determined?\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn India, compensation determination involves a combination of factors, including market practices, legal regulations, industry standards, and individual performance:\n\n\n* Job role and responsibilities\n* Industry and market trends\n* Geographical location\n* Company size and financial health\n* Experience and expertise\n* Education and qualifications\n* Performance and contributions\n* Legal and regulatory factors (mentioned in the above sections)\n* Gender equality and non-discrimination\n* Collective bargaining and industry standards\n* Benefits and perks\n* Inflation and economic conditions\n\n\nThings to be considered by HR Leaders to ensure effective compensation management\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Market Research:** Conduct regular surveys and research to stay updated on industry compensation trends. This helps in ensuring your organization\u2019s compensation packages remain competitive and relevant.\n* **Internal Equity:** Ensure that compensation is fair and consistent within your organization. Employees performing similar roles should receive similar compensation, considering factors like experience, qualifications, and performance.\n* **External Competitiveness:** Benchmark your organization\u2019s compensation against similar roles in other companies to ensure your packages are competitive. Being under or over market rates can affect your ability to attract and retain talent.\n* **Total Rewards:** Consider the entire compensation package, including base salary, bonuses, incentives, benefits, and perks. A well-rounded package can enhance the perceived value of compensation.\n* **Variable Pay and Performance Incentives:** Incorporate performance-based pay to motivate employees and reward high performance. Define clear and measurable performance metrics linked to incentives.\n* **Transparency:** Maintain transparency in compensation practices. Employees should understand how compensation decisions are made, including the criteria for raises, bonuses, and promotions.\n* **Job Evaluation and Grading:** Implement a structured job evaluation system to assess the relative worth of different roles within the organization. This helps in setting compensation levels based on job responsibilities and requirements.\n* **Legal Compliance:** Stay informed about labor laws, minimum wage regulations, and equal pay laws in your jurisdiction. Ensure that your compensation practices adhere to these laws to avoid legal issues.\n* **Communication:** Clearly communicate compensation structures, policies, and changes to employees. This reduces misunderstandings and helps employees appreciate the value of their compensation.\n* **Flexibility:** Consider offering flexible compensation options, such as flexible work arrangements, stock options, or cafeteria-style benefits. This caters to diverse employee preferences and needs.\n* **Budget Alignment:** Ensure that your compensation practices align with the organization\u2019s budget and financial goals. Overcommitting to compensation can strain financial resources.\n* **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review and adjust compensation structures to account for inflation, changes in market conditions, and organizational growth. This prevents compensation from becoming outdated.\n* **Equity and Inclusion:** Be mindful of potential biases in compensation decisions. Regularly review compensation data to ensure there are no disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or other factors.\n* **Employee Feedback:** Seek input from employees about their compensation preferences and concerns. This can provide valuable insights for refining compensation strategies.\n* **Training and Development:** Offer training to HR personnel involved in compensation management to ensure they have a deep understanding of the factors that influence compensation decisions.\n* **Retention Strategy:** Use compensation strategically to retain top performers and key talent. Identify critical roles and individuals who contribute significantly to the organization\u2019s success.\n* **Performance Evaluation:** Establish a robust performance evaluation process that ties compensation decisions to objective performance metrics, fostering a merit-based culture.\n\n\nBenefits of Compensation Management\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**For Organizations**\n\n\n* Attracts and retains top talent\n* Motivates performance and productivity\n* Increases employee satisfaction and engagement\n* Aligns with business objectives\n* Drives better organizational performance\n* Encourages talent development\n* Retains key employees\n* Enhances cost efficiency\n* Mitigates compliance and legal risks\n* Builds a positive employer brand\n\n\n**For Employees:**\n\n\n* Ensures fairness in rewards\n* Motivates through performance-based pay\n* Provides recognition for achievements\n* Supports financial security\n* Boosts job satisfaction\n* Increases retention rates\n* Promotes professional growth\n* Ensures equity in compensation\n* Improves work-life balance\n* Fosters long-term commitment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompensation Management Software \u2013 RazorpayX Payroll\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[RazorpayX Payroll](https://razorpay.com/payroll/) is India\u2019s ONLY fully automated compensation management and payroll software.

Sounds interesting? Unusual even\u2026\n\n\nAs a technical writer myself, having spent over a decade in this field \u2013 I found it awkward when I first learnt from a colleague that [Razorpay Documentation](https://razorpay.com/docs/#home-payments) uses VS Code for authoring. It was the second day at work, and I was still undergoing the Induction and Training sessions. My first thought was, \u201cDid I make the right decision? How did I miss asking about the authoring tool we use during my interviews?\u201d\n\n\nPerplexed and yet, curious about what was in store, I embarked on this journey. My very skilled colleague trained me on VS Code and how it can be used as an authoring tool. I was awed at both its simplicities as well as complexities at the same time.\n\n\n### The \u2018Docs-as-code\u2019 approach\n\n\nBefore we talk about [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), let us understand what \u2018Docs as Code\u2019 is.\n\n\nDocumentation as Code or more popularly known as \u2018Docs as Code\u2019, refers to an ideology that you should treat documentation in the same way as you would treat coding, including using the same tools as code. Some examples include:\n\n\n* Issue Trackers such as [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira?&aceid=&adposition=&adgroup=143485223644&campaign=18442427757&creative=666244286838&device=c&keyword=jira&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p73345677068&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001558501&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrfymBhCTARIsADXTabmaOh0jn9Ii_X5pKxMKTZgll9ctWTdev_OarWLHDW2dOnKzJDJbkAcaApwrEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), [Asana](https://asana.com/?noredirect)\n* Plain Text Markup such as VS Code\n* Version Control such as [Helix](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core), [GitHub](https://github.com/razorpay)\n* Code Reviews such as GitHub\n* Automated Tests such as [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)\n\n\nThis methodology presses upon following the same workflows as development teams to ensure there is total synchronization with the Product Teams. Unlike in a regular framework, the Docs-as-Code approach lays emphasis on giving equal responsibility to Technical Writers and Developers for maintaining Technical Documentation.\n\n\n### VS Code as an Authoring Tool\n\n\nYes, it is not uncommon anymore to come across Technical Writers who use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as their preferred text editor for writing technical documentation. VS Code is a popular and powerful code editor developed by Microsoft that offers a wide range of features and extensions that can enhance the writing process.\n\n\nIt is comparable to most WYSIWYG editors in terms of the features offered:\n\n\n* **Rich text editing**: VS Code provides a robust text editing experience with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and automatic formatting, which can be beneficial for writing technical documentation with code snippets or formatting requirements.\n* **Markdown support**: Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used by technical writers for creating documentation. VS Code has excellent Markdown support, including previewing and rendering Markdown files, making it a convenient choice for creating and editing Markdown-based documents.\n* **Extensions and plugins**: VS Code has a vast ecosystem of extensions and plugins that can be installed to customize the editor according to specific needs. Technical writers can find extensions for spell-checking, word count, table formatting, version control integration, and more to enhance their productivity.\n* **Integration with Git**: Technical writers often collaborate with developers and use version control systems like Git to manage document revisions. VS Code has built-in Git integration, allowing writers to manage their documentation repositories, track changes, and collaborate seamlessly with developers.\n* **Cross-platform compatibility**: VS Code is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems, making it a versatile choice for technical writers working on different platforms.\n* **Snippets**: Another useful feature for writers in VSC is Snippets. Snippets are pieces of code authored and saved as templates for quick use. Writers can create snippets for codes used repeatedly for creating tables, inserting images and videos, and so on.\n\n\n### Collaboration\n\n\nAnother major advantage of using VS Code is the ease and flexibility it offers to collaborate with development teams. With most traditional WYSIWYG editors, which come with limited licenses, reviews become challenging. Technical Writers mostly generate PDFs or Word Documents and share them with the Product Teams or Developers to review the document for technical or functional accuracy. Comments are entered in the PDFs; Technical Writers address these comments on their systems and generate PDFs again for the next iteration.\n\n\nWith VS Code, this problem is almost eliminated since Developers already use the tool and can be given access to the files themselves; they can review documents directly from the writer\u2019s repo. There is no question of generating PDFs and going back and forth multiple times just to close the review cycle. The time and effort thus saved is enormous, considering review cycles take more time than the authoring itself.\n\n\n### Empathising with the Developer Community\n\n\nAs an API-centric company, it is absolutely critical that we writers understand and empathise with the Developer community who consume our content day in, day out. A major chunk of our documentation is about APIs, and it helps immensely if we can understand the nuances of coding if we are to tailor our content for the Developer community. It has also sensitised us towards the issues faced by developers and how we can help them in mitigating them.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\nWhile WYSIWYG Editors have their own fan base, Markdown Editors, such as VS Code, are increasingly gaining popularity. It is a rare combination of simplicity and complexity going hand-in-hand and a preferred choice for writers who have a keen interest in coding. The choice ultimately depends on many factors such as the content complexity, variety of use cases, number of tech writers, level of customization needed and how much the organization is ready to invest in deciding the best writing tool for the Tech Writers. While VS Code is a versatile authoring and publishing tool, it also comes with its set of challenges. Evaluate all the factors before zeroing in on the best one that meets your requirements.", "[August 22, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/b2c-business/)\n\n7 Mins Read\n\n\n**What is Business-to-Consumer (B2C)?**\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nAny business that directly sells products to the end user is a B2C. Today, the most popular B2C businesses are online retailers \u2013 companies like Nykaa or Amazon. But the umbrella of B2C includes a lot more.\n\n\nTraditionally, B2C businesses included mall outlets, small businesses, or restaurants that didn\u2019t have any middleman between the creator of the product and the end user.\u00a0\n\n\nThe rise of the internet resulted in a new B2C business format altogether, in the form of e-commerce platforms, i.e. selling of goods and services online. Amazon, Flipkart, Ola, Swiggy, Nykaa, OLX and BookMyShow are some examples of B2C e-commerce businesses in India.\n\n\nMarketing is very important in the B2C space, since individual consumers are a lot more emotionally driven and do not show as much stickiness to product as compared to businesses.\n\n\nB2C vs B2B\n----------\n\n\nWhile B2C sells directly to the consumer, B2B is any business that caters to other businesses.\n\n\n\n\n| Feature | B2C | B2B |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Target audience | Individual consumers | Businesses |\n| Buying process | Shorter and more impulsive | Longer and more deliberate |\n| Decision-making process | More emotional | More rational |\n| Volume of transactions | Smaller | Larger |\n| Value of transactions | Smaller | Larger |\n| Marketing channels | More focused on online and offline advertising | More focused on business-to-business (B2B) events, trade shows, and online marketing |\n| Sales cycle | Shorter | Longer |\n| Customer relationship | More transactional | More long-term |\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Types of B2C Models**\n-----------------------\n\n\n* **Direct Sellers**\n\n\nDirect sellers are the most common business-to-consumer business. These are retail stores or sites from where consumers directly make purchases. Small businesses, producers and manufacturers are examples of direct sellers who market their products directly to their consumers.\n\n\n* **Intermediaries**\n\n\nIntermediaries are online platforms that connect buyers with sellers in exchange for a commission. The most important reason why consumers choose online intermediaries is because they offer low prices. Amazon, Etsy and eBay are some of the examples of online intermediaries.\n\n\n* **Advertising-based**\n\n\nB2C companies like YouTube, Facebook and Reddit provide free services to attract visitors. Then, they advertise products and services from other companies to visitors to generate revenue. Traffic-driving strategies like content marketing and social media marketing are used by B2C advertising businesses.\n\n\nB2C advertising-based companies earn profits by selling advertising spaces. Sellers, on the other hand, get the benefit of online visibility, generate revenue and get their leads converted.\n\n\n* **Community-based**\n\n\nCommunity businesses choose online communities and social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and other online platforms to market their products directly to site users.\n\n\n* **Fee-based**\n\n\nFee-based B2C companies are usually e-commerce businesses which require users to pay a subscription fee to access their services. Examples include Netflix, Spotify, The Wall Street Journal and Hulu.\u00a0\n\n\n**What Are the Benefits of B2C?**\n---------------------------------\n\n\nLet\u2019s explore the benefits of owning a B2C business:\u00a0\n\n\n* **Larger Reach:** B2C businesses can reach a global audience with the right marketing channels thanks to the huge interest and creative strategies they can employ.\n\n\n* **Minimum Cost and Expenses:** Online B2C businesses enjoy reduced overhead expenses \u2013 they don\u2019t need to spend on rent, warehousing, inventory or electricity.\n\n\n* **Access to Customer Data:** Considering that a B2C business deals directly with customers, it has better and direct access to valuable data about customers. They can easily get insights such as customer behaviour, conversion statistics and demographic details.\n* **Customer Personalisation:** B2C businesses usually enjoy a closer relationship with their customers than B2B businesses. Think about Zomato\u2019s marketing strategy \u2013 the casual tone and relaxed humour makes B2C businesses feel a lot more approachable.\n\n\n**B2C Challenges**\n------------------\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at the challenges of running a B2C business:\u00a0\n\n\n* Business-to-consumer businesses face massive competition in the market. To survive, one has to market their product and brand well.\n* Customer retention and satisfaction is a big challenge. Investing in innovative marketing and attracting customers is essential.\n\n\n\n**10 Best B2C Marketing Strategies**\n------------------------------------\n\n\nB2C businesses pay a lot of attention to their marketing strategy. While businesses are more logical and methodical when deciding what to buy or who to buy from, individual consumers are more emotionally-driven and unconsciously rely on cues from advertisement they\u2019d seen, or word of mouth.\u00a0\n\n\nThis makes it very important for B2Cs to have a robust marketing strategy in place to ensure they reach their target audience, build brand awareness, generate leads, and drive sales. Here are a few marketing strategies that the top B2Cs in India use.\n\n\n1. **Content marketing:** Create and share valuable content that is relevant to your target audience. This could include blog posts, articles, infographics, e-books, or videos. For example, a clothing brand could create a blog post about how to style different types of jeans. For example, Nykaa has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVldBfiVGvo) where they post relatable, funny and promotional content for their user base.\n2. **Search engine optimisation (SEO):** Optimise your website and content for search engines so that your website appears higher in search results pages. For example, any time you search for practically any product on Google, you see shopping sites like Amazon, Flipkart or IKEA right at the top.\n3. **Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising:**\u00a0Pay for ads to appear at the top of search results pages. This is a great way to reach a large audience quickly. For example, an electronics brand could run PPC ads for the keyword \u201claptops.\u201d\n4. **Social media marketing:** Use social media platforms to connect with your target audience and promote your products or services. Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and YouTube are powerful tools to reach your audience, and many B2C businesses have huge followings on these social media. For example, Netflix\u2019s Instagram has 33 million followers.\n5. **Email marketing:**\u00a0Collect email addresses from your target audience and send them regular emails with updates about your business, new products or services, and special offers. For example, a subscription box company could send out email newsletters to its subscribers with details about the latest products in its box.\n6. **Influencer marketing:** Partner with influencers who have a large following in your target audience. This could involve having them promote your products or services on their social media channels or in their blog posts. For example, a fashion brand could partner with a fashion blogger to promote its latest collection.\n7. **Affiliate marketing:**\u00a0Partner with other businesses to promote your products or services. This could involve paying them a commission for every sale they generate. For example, an online retailer could partner with a travel agency to promote its travel packages.\n8. **Guerrilla marketing:** Use unconventional and creative marketing tactics to get attention. This could involve stunts, street performances, or handing out flyers. For example, a restaurant could create a food truck that drives around town and gives out free samples.\n9. **Public relations:**\u00a0Get your business mentioned in the media. This could involve issuing press releases, pitching stories to journalists, or hosting events. For example, a cosmetics brand could host a celebrity makeup tutorial to get attention from the media.\n10. **Direct marketing:** Send direct mail or email to your target audience.

This funding option allows you to draw on the approved credit line whenever the need arises, giving you a safety net to manage fluctuating cash flows and unforeseen expenditures.\n\n\nFor businesses, lines of credit come in various forms, such as revolving and non-revolving lines. These can be used strategically to cover short-term operational costs, seize growth opportunities, manage inventory, and bridge gaps in cash flow. Importantly, you\u2019ll only pay interest on the funds you actually use, making it an efficient financing solution tailored to your business needs.\n\n\nPS: Are you looking for Line of Credit for your business? Click on the CTA below \ud83d\udc47\n\n\n\nLetter of Credit: Ensuring Secure International Transactions\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn the realm of international trade, a letter of credit serves as a critical tool for businesses engaged in global markets. It acts as a guarantee from a bank to both the seller (beneficiary) and the buyer (importer), assuring that payment will be made promptly and goods will be delivered as specified.\n\n\nThe process involves multiple parties, including the exporter, importer, issuing bank, confirming bank, and carrier. Letters of credit can be tailored to different scenarios, such as revocable or irrevocable, confirmed or unconfirmed, depending on the level of security needed. By utilising a letter of credit, you can navigate complex international transactions with confidence, minimising risks and ensuring smooth trade operations.\n\n\n**Key Differences in Business Context: Line of Credit vs. Letter of Credit**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn the realm of business finance, the distinctions between a line of credit vs. letter of credit are pivotal. Lines of credit provide your business with adaptable financing options, supporting day-to-day operations and growth initiatives. On the other hand, letters of credit offer the assurance needed to engage in global trade by guaranteeing secure payments and timely deliveries.\n\n\nInvolving parties, purpose, and processes vary significantly between the two. While a line of credit centres around your business and the lender, a letter of credit encompasses multiple stakeholders, ensuring the interests of both buyer and seller in international transactions.\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Aspect** | **Line of Credit for Businesses** | **Letter of Credit for Businesses** |\n| Definition | A flexible financing arrangement where a lender offers a credit limit that the business can draw upon as needed. | A bank-issued guarantee that ensures secure payment and delivery of goods in international trade transactions. |\n| Purpose | Provides adaptable funding for various business needs, including operational expenses, growth initiatives, and cash flow management. | Facilitates international trade by minimising payment and delivery risks between businesses across borders. |\n| Parties Involved | Business owner (borrower) and Lender (financial institution). | Exporter, Importer (buyer), Issuing Bank, Confirming Bank, Carrier (for shipping). |\n| Usage | Flexible funding for short-term cash flow challenges, expansion, inventory management, and seizing business opportunities. | Ensures payment security and delivery of goods in international trade, reducing risks for both parties. |\n| Interest | Interest charged on the amount borrowed; rates may vary based on the lender\u2019s terms. | Typically no interest; fees and charges related to documentation and processing may apply. |\n| Security | Lender may or may not require collateral or personal/business assets to secure the line of credit. | Offers a secure payment mechanism, safeguarding businesses against non-payment and delivery issues. |\n| Flexibility | Businesses can access funds within the credit limit as needed, providing agility in managing financial requirements. | Involves a structured process and adherence to international trade regulations, offering standardized security. |\n| Risk Mitigation | Borrower assumes repayment responsibility; collateral may be at risk in case of default. | Provides risk mitigation for both importer and exporter, ensuring payment and goods delivery in cross-border transactions. |\n| Complexity | Generally straightforward, with fewer parties involved; documentation may be less complex. | Involves multiple stakeholders, documentation, and adherence to international trade standards, potentially adding complexity. |\n| Applicability | Suited for businesses seeking short-term funding, cash flow management, and tailored financing solutions. | Primarily used by businesses engaged in international trade to ensure secure and smooth cross-border transactions. |\n| Examples | Access to working capital, managing seasonal fluctuations, expanding operations. | Engaging in global trade, mitigating payment and delivery risks across borders. |\n\n\nLine of Credit vs. Letter of Credit: Choosing Wisely\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSelecting between a line of credit vs. letter of credit hinges on your business objectives and the context of your financial transactions. If your goal is to secure flexible financing to fuel growth or navigate seasonal fluctuations, a line of credit is a valuable asset.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re venturing into international markets and require a secure payment mechanism, a letter of credit is your strategic choice.\n\n\nEmpowering Business Owners with Financial Clarity\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs a business owner, recognising the divergences between a line of credit vs. letter of credit empowers you to make informed financial decisions that drive success. These instruments, tailored to meet distinct business needs, play pivotal roles in managing your finances, fostering growth, and ensuring seamless global trade operations.\n\n\nBy embracing the nuances of a line of credit vs. letter of credit, you pave the way for financial prosperity, strategic expansion, and secure international business ventures.\n\n\n\nExplore Razorpay Line of Credit for Businesses\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\nDid you know that there are innovative solutions tailored to modern business needs?

In reality, the concept is quite simple.\n\n\nHere\u2019s a detailed guide to everything you need to know about vesting, whether you are an employer, employee, or just plain curious!\n\n\n**Basics of Vesting**\n---------------------\n\n\nSimply put, vesting is an employee retention technique.\n\n\nEmployers give their employees a guarantee that if they stay for a specified term of employment, they will earn assets like equity stocks or retirement plans.\n\n\nThe intent is to give employees an incentive to stay with the business. Retaining top talent should be every business\u2019s major goal, alongside profitability and growth.\n\n\nLet\u2019s understand how vested benefits work with the most common vested benefit: ESOP, or the Employee Stock Option Plan.\n\n\n### **Understanding Employee Stock Options (ESOPs)**\n\n\nAn ESOP is a contract that gives an employee the right to buy a stock at a predetermined price for a finite period of time.\n\n\nWatch the below video for more:\n\n\n\n<https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/07/Vesting.mp4>\n#### How are ESOPs Vested?\n\n\nAs a vested benefit, employees have to fulfil the requirements of their vesting schedule in order to gain ownership of their ESOPs.\n\n\nESOPs typically start vesting only after a cliff period. Cliff period is the minimum period that an employee has to work for the company before any of the options start vesting. Let\u2019s understand how ESOPs are vested using an example.\n\n\n#### Example of ESOP\n\n\nA company offers 100 ESOPs to its employee with the following conditions.\n\n\n* Options granted: 100\n* Grant price: Rs 1\n* Cliff period: 1 year\n* Vesting schedule: Time-based, 20% each year\n\n\nAfter this initial one-year cliff period, 20% of the options will vest in the first year. This means that the employee can exercise 20% of his stock options by purchasing the shares at the predetermined price of Rs 1.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2023 |\n| Stock Units Vested | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 |\n| Total Units Vested | 20 | 40 | 60 | 80 | 100 |\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEvery year, 20% of the stock options vest \u2013 which means by the end of the fifth year, the employee can exercise all 100 of the stock options given.\n\n\nVesting Schedule: Meaning & Types\n---------------------------------\n\n\nAll vested benefits follow a vesting schedule, which details how the employee earns the benefits.\u00a0These schedules can be tied to a period of time, a milestone, or a mix of both. Let\u2019s understand each one.\n\n\n#### Time-Based Vesting Schedule\n\n\n![vesting schedule - time based ](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/07/vesting-graphic-e1689680554246.png)This kind of vesting schedule gives the employee ownership of the asset over a period of time. The asset begins to vest after the cliff period.\n\n\nThe cliff period is the minimum required term of employment after which the employee begins to gain ownership of the asset.\u00a0\n\n\n#### Milestone-Based Vesting Schedule\n\n\nUnder a milestone-based vesting period, the employee gains ownership of the asset after a certain milestone is reached. The milestone is predetermined, and could be an IPO, completion of a business project or when the company hits a certain valuation.\n\n\n#### Hybrid Vesting Schedule\n\n\nA combination of both time and milestone based vesting schedules requires the employee to complete a period of employment and also hit the pre-decided milestone.\n\n\n\n\n| Vesting schedule | Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cliff vesting | Simple to understand and administer | Risky for employees |\n| Gradual vesting | More employee-friendly | More complex to administer |\n| Hybrid vesting | Best of both worlds | Can be more complex to administer than cliff vesting |\n\n\nHow to Calculate Vesting?\n-------------------------\n\n\nThe formula for calculating vesting is:\n\n\n**Vested shares = (Number of shares x Vesting percentage) / 100**\n\n\nFor example, if an employee has 100 shares of stock options with a vesting percentage of 25%, they would have 25 vested shares after one year.\n\n\nTax Implications of Vesting in India\n------------------------------------\n\n\nIn India, stock options and RSUs are taxed as perquisite income. This means that the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date is clubbed with the employee\u2019s salary and taxed as per the applicable tax slab.\n\n\nThe tax rate for stock options or RSUs depends on the employee\u2019s income tax slab. For example, if an employee is in the 30% tax bracket, they would pay 30% tax on the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date.\n\n\nIf you sell your vested shares, you will be taxed on the capital gains at the following rates:\n\n\n\n\n| Holding period | Capital gains tax rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| Less than 3 years | 15% |\n| More than 3 years | 10% |\n\n\n**Why is Vesting a Popular Employee Retention Technique?**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVested benefits are a win-win situation to both employer and employee. By offering a retention incentive to top talent, employers ensure low attrition rates. Founders who don\u2019t have to worry about losing top talent can focus on expansion and growth!\n\n\nVested benefits like ESOPs and deferred bonus are only part of a larger financial strategy that all successful, high-growth businesses must have in place.\n\n\nHere\u2019s a few other strategies that employers keep in mind for good money management:\n\n\n* A solid investment strategy and a well-diversified [portfolio](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/portfolio/)\n* A well-thought out budget and forecast plan for each quarter\n* [Automated financial management](https://razorpay.com/x?r=blog_cta_business_banking_vesting&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=cta) for minimal errors and smooth finances\n\n\n**Learn more: [Automated Business Finances](https://razorpay.com/x?r=vesting&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=cta)**\n\n\nVested vs Non-Vested Benefits\n-----------------------------\n\n\nCompanies also offer non-vested benefits, which do not follow a vesting schedule. These do not contribute to long-term employee retention efforts, but are just as important.\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Aspect** | **Vested Benefits** | **Non-Vested Benefits** |\n| Definition | Benefits earned and fully owned over time | Benefits immediately accessible upon employment |\n| Ownership | Full ownership after completing vesting period | Immediate ownership upon joining the company |\n| Vesting Period | Requires a specific length of service to vest | No vesting period required |\n| Forfeiture | May be forfeited if employee leaves before vesting | No forfeiture as benefits are immediately owned |\n| Examples | Employer contributions to retirement plans like Provident Fund | Basic salaries, PTO, health insurance, bonuses |\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n### FAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n### What does vesting mean?\n\n\n\nVesting refers to the process by which an individual gains ownership or entitlement to a particular asset, typically through the passage of time or meeting certain conditions. It is commonly associated with employee stock options, retirement plans, and other long-term incentive programs. \n\n\n\n\n\n### What is an example of vesting?\n\n\n\nFor example, you are granted 1,000 ESOs with an exercise price of Rs 10 per share. The options have a vesting period of four years with a one-year cliff. This means that you need to work for XYZ Corporation for one year before any of the options vest. After that initial one-year cliff, the options begin to vest gradually over the remaining three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n### How is vesting calculated?\n\n\n\nVesting is typically calculated based on a predetermined schedule that outlines when and how an individual gains ownership or entitlement to a particular asset. The most common method for calculating vesting involves using a linear or stepped approach over a specified period.", "[August 20, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/digital-wallet-guide/)\n\n7 Mins Read\n\n\nThe value of all digital payment transactions made in India in January 2023 alone was a whopping Rs [12.98 lakh crore.](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1897272)\u00a0This is undeniable proof that our preferred mode of making and receiving payments is changing.\n\n\nDigital wallets are an important part of this online payments ecosystem.

Writing or reviewing messages effectively is part of your job if you are a Technical Writer,\u00a0 UX Writer, Content Writer or Marketing Executive. Different messages appear on user screens, emails/short messages on mobile/WhatsApp and social media platforms, and the purpose of each message is specific. So, you must be mindful of various factors when writing these messages.\n\n\nBut, before we talk about messages, it is important to understand why messages are important. We at [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/) are encouraged to ask why we are doing it before we start doing it. The logic is simple \u2013 if we are convinced it is essential, we give our best! So, let\u2019s evaluate.\n\n\n**Why Messaging is Important**\n------------------------------\n\n\nMessages are the way to communicate with your users.\n\n\n1. **Tell them about your product or service:** You must have received promotional messages from various companies about a sale, discounts, or a new launch. These messages drive curiosity, awareness, and engagement and help increase sales.\n2. **Tell them \u2013 what to do and how to do things using your product or service.** On-screen instructions to perform actions on a website or mobile app, email communications or WhatsApp messages about how to do certain things. For example, how to set your ATM pin for your Credit Card using Netbanking.\n3. **Assure your users.** The in-app pop-up messages or notifications sent on your email, phone number or WhatsApp informing you about the success/failure of an action, help you understand the outcome and what is expected from you. For example, a confirmation message on your screen after you successfully place an order on Amazon. Or a message from your bank about a failed payment transaction assuring you of a refund if your money got debited. All of these assure the users and help in building trust.\n\n\n### Influence of Social Media\n\n\nMessaging has become more critical with the introduction of Social Media in our lives. Communication with users has become two-way. Brands use Social Media posts to announce new launches, products, services, discounts and achievements. Users like, comment and re-share these posts. Users can also reach out to the brands directly. They can now share their thoughts, feedback, frustration, and happiness with the organisations. Brands must be prompt, accurate and careful while responding to these messages. A well-crafted message could win you accolades, but if you miss the point- be ready for bricks and bats!\n\n\n![Example of response on a social media platform](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-21-at-10.46.40-AM-1.png)\n\n\nSo now we are convinced that messaging is important and must be done right. Let us start by understanding the different types of messages and notifications that need to be written.\n\n\n**Types of Messages and Notifications**\n---------------------------------------\n\n\n### **Success/Failure Messages**\n\n\nRegistering for a website or creating an account, making a payment or filing your Income Tax returns \u2013 you receive a confirmation notification on your screen, indicating your actions\u2019 success or failure. These messages are critical as they help the user understand the outcome of the action.\n\n\n### **Example of a success and failure messageError and Validation Messages**\n\n\nTrying to upload an attachment?\u00a0 \u201c*The file you are trying to attach either exceeds the size limit* *or does not match the format that the platform supports!*\u201d A typical validation message pops up.\n\n\nYou see validation messages when trying to fill a form, and a few mandatory fields are not filled or contain unsupported special characters. These messages help the users understand what went wrong and guide them to make the corrections.\n\n\n### **Example of a validation messageMessages on Decision Modals**\n\n\nThe\u00a0 Decision Modals are those dialogue boxes where you must choose between two or more actions. Based on what you choose, the next page appears on your screen.\n\n\n### **Example of a decision modalPush Notifications**\n\n\nYour mailbox must be filled with email notifications about a new order placed on Swiggy, a utility bill paid, a credit card statement, a failed net banking attempt and many more. These are automated messages sent by systems whenever an event occurs.\n\n\n### **Example of a push notificationSMS**\n\n\nSMS messages are sent to your mobile numbers. These are similar to email notifications and triggered on an event but crisper. The SMS messages must be short, as each has a character limit.\n\n\nSMS messages are beneficial for sending messages that require quick action from users\u2014for example, OTP, notifications about account debit or a user login from an unidentified device.\n\n\n### **WhatsApp Messages**\n\n\nBusinesses use WhatsApp Business to send out quick notifications similar to SMS messages. WhatsApp messages can be longer as they don\u2019t have a character limit like SMS messages. WhatsApp messages are often used for promotional purposes and other communications like reminding about a bill payment date or asking for user feedback.\n\n\n### **Example of a WhatsApp message alertPromotional Messages**\n\n\nThese are the messages you receive via emails, SMS or WhatsApp messages about a new promotion, offer, product or service or to encourage users to buy more products or avail of more services.\n\n\n### **Example of a promotional messageSocial Media Messages**\n\n\nThe brands post Social Media messages using their social media handle, announcing a new product or service, the latest offers, heavy discounts or achievements.\n\n\n![Announcement on social media](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-21-at-11.43.25-AM-1.png)Organisations use social media messages to send out a social message to strike a chord with more people.\u00a0 The interesting point about social media messages is that it offers two-way communication. Users can like, comment, and re-share the posts. Users can also directly communicate with brands on the Social Media platform.\n\n\nNow that we understand the various types of messages let\u2019s see how to write effective messages so that our message is not lost.\n\n\nHow to Write Effective Messages\n-------------------------------\n\n\n### **Before You Start Writing**\n\n\n#### Understand the Audience\n\n\nWhen writing a message, it is crucial to know whom you are writing for and what kind of message it is. For example, if you are writing for a naive user, be direct and clear about the message and if any action is expected from them. Check our blog on [Audience Research](https://razorpay.com/learn/guide-to-audience-research-tech-writing/) here.\n\n\n#### Understand the Purpose\n\n\nWhat is the intention of the message? For example, your tone can be informal when writing a promotional message. Add some fun elements such as emojis, gifs or pictures in your content to make your message more engaging.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if your message is about, say, a possible cyber attack on a user account, be sensitive about the matter, caution the user and add what they should do as the next steps.\n\n\n#### Understand the User Journey\n\n\nBe conscious of where the user is in their user journey. Say, a user has created an account. The tone of the message should be welcoming and congratulatory. On the contrary, say a user deletes their account, the message could express sadness about losing a valuable user and how they could return.\n\n\n#### Understand the Medium\n\n\nBased on the medium \u2013 email, SMS or WhatsApp, decide how long the message should be and what elements to use as part of your content. For example, email communications can be longer with graphics, while SMS messages must be short and on point.\n\n\n### **Write Your Message**\n\n\nOnce you have understood your audience, purpose, medium and user journey of your audience, you must consider the following points to write effective messages:\n\n\n##### Content is King\n\n\nThe message should have helpful information. For example, if you are writing error messages, you should say what the error is, the possible cause, and what the user needs to do to fix the error.\n\n\n##### Language \u2013 Keep it Easy\n\n\nThe language should be easy to understand. The messages on pop-up boxes should be clear and to the point. The users take a fraction of a second to decide and click an option. Use proper icons and colours to indicate critical actions. Talk to your UX expert to decide on the colours, placement, icons and other factors to ensure your users understand the message well before making a decision.\n\n\n##### Tone \u2013 Industry, Brand Image and User Journey\n\n\nThe tone of the messages depends upon several factors, such as the industry, your brand image and where your user is in the user journey.\n\n\n##### Make Your Content Engaging\n\n\nUse images, emojis, videos, or gifs to connect with your users. The use of high-resolution graphics, memes and funny emojis, and a tinge of humour have proven to be effective in keeping the readers interested.\n\n\nWith companies increasing their presence on social media, support executives, techies, and marketers ensure they leave no stone unturned to create a positive brand image.\n\n\nFinal Words\n-----------\n\n\nMessaging is essential to designing a product or service and creating a powerful brand image. Whatever the medium is, the message must be prompt, accurate, straightforward, and aesthetically designed. Getting your message right is crucial for your sales, gaining customer love and trust, and your organisation\u2019s brand and reputation. You have to get it right, always!", "[August 18, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/the-importance-of-a-glossary/)\n\n6 Mins Read\n\n\nDo you recall literature textbooks from your school days? Hefty and laden with discoveries? Across all language text books, one common thing was the chapter-end exercises, of course, but also the list of meanings right after the end of the lesson.\n\n\nSuch literature often contained complex, period-specific wording choices that spun our heads. So the meanings lists made the text accessible and easy to understand. They remained a steady, reliable source that helped me decipher the text with relative context and simplicity.\n\n\nAs I grew older, I found such lists everywhere. Think of dictionaries, directories, end-notes, citations, and glossaries. Diverse as they are, they served a singular purpose:\u00a0\n\n\n*They were simple, concise, one-stop lists and acted as excellent references.*\n\n\nIn a documentation context, such lists are arranged as a glossary: a list of terminologies simplified using contextual explanations.\n\n\n**Does Anybody Read Glossaries?**\n=================================\n\n\nI\u2019ll admit: going through the meanings solely wasn\u2019t so fun. Glossaries are used less for reading and are more commonly used to take references and immediate help. When you notice an unfamiliar word, you try to remove that uncertainty with some help.\u00a0\n\n\n*![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-18-at-4.27.12-PM.png)A vintage glossary page*\n\n\nConsider [Razorpay Docs](https://razorpay.com/docs/#home-payments), our documentation platform. We host countless articles and media about multiple Razorpay products, spanning across countries and industries, containing complex application and code integrations to industry-specific business finance management.\u00a0\n\n\nThe scope for technical jargon is vast. While we make our documentation accessible, it\u2019s critical to [balance the document\u2019s intent with the audience](https://razorpay.com/learn/guide-to-audience-research-tech-writing/). Even if we tried simplifying the language, we would still face problems. For example:\n\n\n* \u2018Bookkeeping\u2019 is specific to accounting. Any mention may confuse the reader, but we cannot switch it to something simpler for non-accounting audiences.\n* Razorpay\u2019s products commonly use \u2018merchant\u2019 and \u2018businesses\u2019 interchangeably, although they may not mean the same thing as in a dictionary.\n* \u2018Authorisation\u2019 can mean two different things when considering it for API or bank transfer authorisation.\n\n\nSo how do we bridge this gap? With a Glossary! Often users come across a foreign term but do not need a detailed process explanation at that moment. Glossaries fit this spot: they are brief and straightforward, offer the necessary information based on the context and provide timely help.\u00a0\n\n\n*![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-18-at-4.30.17-PM.png)Razorpay Docs Payments\u2019 glossary page*\n\n\n**Why (Else) Glossaries?**\n==========================\n\n\nThere is a strong business case, internally and externally, to adopt and maintain one or more glossaries.\u00a0\n\n\n### **Creates Consistency**\n\n\nFor both the organisation and the customer, a glossary ensures the standardisation of content and that we put out industry-par content. Bookkeeping means the same on any page of your documentation.\n\n\n### **Effective Internal Collaboration**\n\n\nKeeping the above point in mind, maintaining a glossary helps teams communicate better internally, externally and cross-functionally, due to its centralised nature.\n\n\nThink of support functions that refer to the glossary while interacting with end users, and organisations that create company-specific glossaries for daily use. Glossaries are used to onboard new employees too.\n\n\nFor example, \u2018Contact\u2019 within Razorpay refers to a business product within the banking suite. We maintain a glossary for internal and external teams to understand that Contact, in this context, is a product offering.\u00a0\n\n\n### **Enhances Understanding**\n\n\nGlossaries simplify complex terminology. Users find relevant and timely information that improves their understanding. As such, Glossary writers undertake thorough research to keep the content up-to-date.\u00a0\n\n\n### **Improves Brand Image**\n\n\nAll of the above points highlight how adding a glossary can make an organisation more accountable and thorough with its services. Such practices solidify reliability, which improves customers\u2019 trust in your services.\u00a0\n\n\n**How to Write a Glossary?**\n============================\n\n\nGlossaries are fun to create. Whether we are creating a stand-alone glossary or multiple of them, some instructions we follow are:\n\n\n##### **Identify Terms**\n\n\nWe follow the following ways to identify a glossary term:\u00a0\n\n\n* Common, recurring and relevant terms.\n* Frequency within the same document.\n* Frequency in multiple documents.\n\n\nFirst, glossaries must contain explanations for recurring and commonly used terminology. If your document uses an abbreviation or a term that repeats multiple times, consider defining it in the glossary. Providing universally accepted definitions of the industry-specific terms is wise.\n\n\nAlso, consider the frequency of these terms within the same document and outside of it. Some words continually appear within the document but are negligible outside that topic. A few others contribute significantly to explaining critical processes irrelevant to where they are originally used.\u00a0\n\n\nSay, for example, industry terms like NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS have found a place in the [RazorpayX Glossary](https://razorpay.com/docs/x/glossary/). These terms are sparsely used but are critical to understanding RazorpayX\u2019s offerings.\n\n\nDue to their contextual relevance over frequency, we have included them in the glossary, which makes the user journey seamless. They would need to refer to the glossary instead of having to put in the effort and Google their meanings. Glossaries present all relevant definitions in one place.\n\n\n##### **Create Style Guides**\n\n\nBy nature, glossaries are meant for reference rather than reading. Writers thus prioritise brevity and use simple but relevant terminology to define complex terms.\n\n\nUndertake target audience research to develop a writing guide and adopt the technology and design to present that information.\n\n\n##### **Get Started**\n\n\nStart creating a repository of definitions on your platform and interlink these definitions wherever they are used in the documents. This can be daunting to start from scratch, but it pays off.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce you have built the glossary, you must also invest in maintaining it. Update and revise the glossary regularly to include every new feature or product the organisation rolls out and the changes in the industry. **FinTech,** which did not exist in the dictionaries a decade back, has become a buzzword and prominent in the current times.\u00a0\n\n\n**To Summarise**\n================\n\n\nGlossaries are an essential part of your content strategy. It makes your content easier to comprehend, consistent, and [accessible](https://razorpay.com/learn/accessibility-in-technical-writing/). Users are looking for precise information, and a glossary brings the content creators and audiences on the same page.\n\n\nGlossaries serve as a bridge between two ends, a perfect balance\u2014as are most things in life best enjoyed.\n\n\n**References:**\n\n\n1. <https://www.bridging-the-gap.com/glossary/>\n2. <https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/glossary-of-a-dissertation/>\n3. <https://www.smartcat.com/blog/making-the-perfect-glossary/>\n4. <https://document360.com/blog/knowledge-management-business-glossary/>\n5. <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955598602000584>", "[August 18, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/conversion-rate-optimization/)\n\n9 Mins Read\n\n\nIn the fiercely competitive digital landscape, businesses are constantly seeking ways to improve their online presence, attract more visitors, and convert them into loyal customers. One of the most effective strategies to achieve these goals is through Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO). However, successful Conversion Rate Optimization goes beyond optimizing just the checkout process; it involves enhancing various aspects of the website to create a seamless and captivating customer journey.\u00a0\n\n\nIn this blog, we will delve into the world of end-to-end website Conversion Rate Optimization, exploring critical elements such as website load time and performance, product page design, return policy implementation, offers and discounts, checkout experience enhancement, and more.\n\n\nWhat is Conversion Rate Optimization?\n=====================================\n\n\nConversion rate optimization (CRO) works its magic by boosting the number of website visitors who actually do what you want them to do. Whether it\u2019s buying something snazzy, adding products to their cart, signing up, completing a form, or simply giving a link some love \u2013 CRO makes it happen!\n\n\nThe Relationship Between Conversion Rate Optimization and Search Engine Optimization\n====================================================================================\n\n\n![Conversion rate optimization and SEO](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/SEO-and-CRO-1024x532.jpg)Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) are two essential components of a successful online marketing strategy, and they are closely interrelated. While SEO focuses on driving organic traffic to a website by optimizing its visibility in search engine results, CRO aims to maximize the percentage of visitors who take the desired action, such as making a purchase or filling out a form.\u00a0\n\n\nThe relationship between CRO and SEO lies in their shared goal of improving the overall performance and effectiveness of a website. By implementing effective CRO strategies, businesses can enhance user experience, reduce bounce rates, and increase conversions, which, in turn, positively impacts SEO. Therefore, a symbiotic approach that integrates both CRO and SEO is critical to maximizing the success of a website, ultimately leading to higher visibility, greater conversions, and long-term growth.\n\n\nBeyond Aesthetics: The Power of Overall Website Performance\n===========================================================\n\n\n![website conversion rate optimization](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/Website-performance-1024x533.jpg)The first step in Conversion Rate Optimization is to ensure your overall website loads quickly and performs seamlessly. Research has shown that users are more likely to abandon a website if it takes too long to load.\u00a0\n\n\nThe look and feel of your website transcend mere aesthetics, acting as the welcoming embrace that draws visitors into your digital realm. Equally vital to the allure of your website is its navigational framework.\u00a0\n\n\nA well-designed navigation system functions as a compass, directing users effortlessly through your offerings. Categories that are thoughtfully organized, wishlists and carts intuitively positioned, and a user-friendly search bar collectively composes a roadmap that paves the way for seamless exploration.\n\n\nImage optimization is crucial as well. It involves compressing and resizing images without compromising quality to reduce the load time, while caching enables the storage of website elements for faster loading upon returning visits. Minimizing HTTP requests is vital in streamlining loading times by combining CSS and JavaScript files. Additionally, CDNs (Content Delivery Network) help in distributing website content across multiple servers worldwide, ensuring faster loading for users globally.\u00a0\n\n\nAs these elements converge in perfect harmony, bounce rates dissipate, and conversions ascend. Every click becomes a journey, every interaction a symphony. Users stay captivated, delighted, and connected, forging a future where your website isn\u2019t just a digital space\u2014it\u2019s an enchanting destination.\n\n\nA Captivating Showcase: Optimizing Product Pages\n================================================\n\n\n![product pages for conversion rate optimization](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/Product-pages-1024x534.png)\n\n\nOnce visitors land on your website, the product pages play a pivotal role in influencing their purchase decisions.\u00a0\n\n\nBegin with crafting captivating [product descriptions](https://razorpay.com/blog/online-business-website-pages-that-matters/), meticulously incorporating catchy titles that encapsulate the essence of your offerings. These descriptions should be a harmonious blend of clarity and persuasion, seamlessly weaving in the unique selling points and benefits that set your products apart.\n\n\nAmp up the visual allure with a gallery of high-quality product images, captured through professional photo shoots. These images, capturing products in their finest detail and from diverse angles, serve as a visual gateway to your offerings. Embrace the power of human models, particularly for categories like apparel, to lend a relatable touch that aids customers in envisioning themselves with the product.\n\n\nLeverage the dynamic impact of product videos. These immersive experiences allow potential buyers to virtually interact with the product, gaining a holistic understanding of its features and functionalities.\n\n\nWhile authenticity is paramount, employ strategic pricing techniques. Utilize artificial pre-discounts and display them strikingly alongside the original price, highlighting the value proposition and incentivizing immediate action.\n\n\nThe foundation of trust is built on the bedrock of customer feedback. Incorporate genuine ratings and reviews, offering potential customers insights into real experiences shared by previous buyers. This transparent display of opinions adds a layer of credibility, nurturing trust in your brand and products.\n\n\nComplement this by introducing subtle yet effective tags such as \u201cBestseller\u201d or \u201cRecent Purchases by 20 People.\u201d These notations subtly guide visitors towards popular and well-received products, aiding them in decision-making. Moreover, invoke a sense of urgency with tags denoting limited availability, gently nudging potential buyers towards prompt action.\n\n\nBuilding Trust: Implementing an Effective Return Policy\n=======================================================\n\n\n![Must have robust return policy](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/return-policy-1024x532.png)A robust return policy is a trust-building mechanism that reassures customers about the quality of products and the company\u2019s commitment to customer satisfaction. To implement an effective return policy through Conversion Rate Optimization, clarity, and transparency are paramount.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is essential to clearly communicate the return policy, outlining conditions, timeframes, and processes in a straightforward manner. Additionally, streamlining the return process to make it hassle-free for customers is crucial.\u00a0\n\n\nBy simplifying the process and making it easy for customers to request returns and track their status, businesses can create a positive experience that fosters trust and encourages future purchases.\u00a0\n\n\nTempting Offers and Discounts: Captivating Your Audience\n========================================================\n\n\n![The do's and don'ts of offering discounts](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/Discounts-Dos-and-donts-1024x534.png)Enticing offers and discounts have the power to attract visitors and nudge them toward making a purchase. To effectively implement promotions and boost conversions, consider creating a sense of urgency with time-bound offers that instill a fear of missing out and encourage immediate action. Utilize customer data to offer personalized discounts based on their preferences and purchase history, catering to their individual needs and preferences.\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, implement tiered promotions based on order value to incentivize higher spending, rewarding customers for larger purchases and fostering a sense of value and exclusivity. By integrating these Conversion Rate Optimization strategies into your marketing efforts, ECommerce businesses can optimize their promotions, captivate their audience, and drive higher conversion rates, ultimately enhancing their online success.\n\n\nThe Smooth Checkout Experience: Sealing the Deal\n================================================\n\n\n![importance of a seamless checkout experience ](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/checkout-Magic-page-1024x535.png)A seamless and user-friendly checkout experience is critical to maximizing conversions, and implementing effective Conversion Rate Optimization strategies can significantly enhance this process.

These help employees reduce their tax liabilities significantly.\u00a0\n\n\nWith a growing focus on employee experience,\u00a0 companies these days are mindful of the efforts and expenses incurred by employees and use flexible benefits for personalising the salary structure and maintaining an employee-friendly culture.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore we dig deeper into the hows and whys of the FBP component in salary, let\u2019s cover the basics.\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n* [What is Flexible Benefit Plan in salary?](#What-is-Flexible-Benefit-Plan-in-salary \"What is Flexible Benefit Plan in salary?\")\n* [Components of FBP](#Components-of-FBP \"Components of FBP\u00a0\")\n\t+ [Food and Beverage costs](#Food-and-Beverage-costs \"Food and Beverage costs\")\n\t+ [Conveyance](#Conveyance \"Conveyance\u00a0\")\n\t+ [Telephone bills](#Telephone-bills \"Telephone bills\")\n* [Benefits of Flexible benefit plan for employees](#Benefits-of-Flexible-benefit-plan-for-employees \"Benefits of Flexible benefit plan for employees\")\n* [Benefits of Flexible benefit plan for employers](#Benefits-of-Flexible-benefit-plan-for-employers \"Benefits of Flexible benefit plan for employers\")\n* [How do you declare FBP in salary?](#How-do-you-declare-FBP-in-salary \"How do you declare FBP in salary?\")\n* [Policies of Flexible Benefit Plan](#Policies-of-Flexible-Benefit-Plan \"Policies of Flexible Benefit Plan\")\n* [Challenges in implementing Flexible Benefit Plan](#Challenges-in-implementing-Flexible-Benefit-Plan \"Challenges in implementing Flexible Benefit Plan\")\n* [Introducing RazorpayX Payroll + Zaggle\u2013A fully Automated Flexi Benefits Experience](#Introducing-RazorpayX-Payroll-Zaggle-A-fully-Automated-Flexi-Benefits-Experience \"Introducing RazorpayX Payroll + Zaggle\u2013A fully Automated Flexi Benefits Experience\")\n\n**What is** **Flexible Benefit Plan in salary?**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA Flexible Benefit Plan or FBP is termed \u2018flexible\u2019 because the company can fix or regulate packages as per Govt compliances, company norms, and the employee\u2019s position. Although the organisation/HR generally allocates salary components, companies should also consult employees when allocating FBP in salaries. The modifications are, however, protected by checks and balances to prevent its misuse.\u00a0\n\n\n**Components of FBP**\n---------------------\n\n\n### **Food and Beverage costs**\n\n\nThe income tax department considers meals and non-alcoholic beverages offered by the company during office time as a benefit for the employee.\u00a0\n\n\nThe company may issue food bills such as meal or grocery coupons (Sodexo coupons or meal vouchers) to its employees ranging from Rs 2200 to Rs 3000. Such bills are is tax-free for the employees and can be reimbursed.\n\n\n### **Conveyance**\n\n\nEmployees commuting to work every day means significant travel time and daily costs. Hence, it\u2019s only understandable for them to expect the employer covers the expenses in some quantity. \n\n\nSome employers compensate for the travel expenses. The expense in the FBP is capped by the employer and may differ from company to company.\n\n\nThe Flexible benefit plan facilitates covering the expenses of employees related to conveyance in the following cases:\u00a0\n\n\n1. **Fuel bills:** Employees may claim the cost of petrol or diesel against submitting bills for the same. FBP allow the inclusion of this essential requirement for funding fuel costs within the salary structure of the employees. While some companies have a minimum amount for claiming the bill, some offer a complete waiver on fuel bills.\n2. **Employer\u2019s Vehicle (Car):** Sometimes the company provides few employees with a car that can be used only for official purposes. In such cases, the employee has to produce a certificate that claims that the vehicle was indeed used for business use only along with the fuel bills for the journey.\u00a0However, if the car provided by the employer is used for both business and personal purposes, then a part of the expenses are met by the employer whereas the rest is paid by the employee themself.\n3. **Employee\u2019s Personal Vehicle (Car):** While some companies provide a select few employees with a car, most companies offer compensation to some employees who use a personal car for office purposes. A separate provision is made in the CTC of such employees.\n4. **Chauffeur service**: For employees in executive positions, some companies offer a flexible benefit of covering the cost of a driver. This component is mentioned in the FBP declaration of the employee\u2019s salary structure.\n\n\n[Suggested Read: Conveyance Allowance Blog](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/conveyance-allowance/)\n\n\n### **Telephone bills**\n\n\nEmployers understand the need for mobile connections/internet service to fulfil official tasks. Therefore, most companies include postpaid mobile service bills and broadband connection bills as part of the flexible benefits plan in the salary.\u00a0\n\n\n**Benefits of Flexible benefit plan for employees**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Tax saving**: Easy restructuring helps employees reduce their tax burden. For example, food bills, mobile phone bills, and travel allowance are not taxable. Factoring in these components can help the employee separate this on the payslip from their basic salary on which tax is calculated.\u00a0\n\n\nIn fact, employers can help save up to Rs. 40,000 in taxes for their employees. It\u2019s a win-win for both the employers, as it helps them build an employee-first culture, and for employees since it becomes an avenue to save more tax.\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Allowances\\*** | **Monthly** | **Annually** | **Tax Savings/Annum** |\n| Slab-1 (5%) | Slab-1 (20%) | Slab-1 (30%) |\n| Meal Card | 3,500 | 42,000 | 2,100 | 8,400 | 12,600 |\n| Fuel Card | 2400 | 28,800 | 1,440 | 5,760 | 8,640 |\n| Gift Card |  | 5,000 | 250 | 1,000 | 1,500 |\n| Telecom | 1,000 | 12,000 | 600 | 2,400 | 3,600 |\n| Attire/Uniform | 1,000 | 12,000 | 600 | 2,400 | 3,600 |\n| Books & Periodicals | 1,000 | 12,000 | 600 | 2,400 | 3,600 |\n| Total Allowance | 8,900 | 1,11,800 |  |  |  |\n| Total Tax Saved |  |  | 5,590 | 22,360 | 33,540 |\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Better financial control & planning:** When employees know that the company offers compensation for certain expenses as part of the monthly salary, they can plan their budget and expenditures for the entire year better.\n\n\n\n**Benefits of Flexible benefit plan for employers**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Employee retention**: Implementing FBP displays the company\u2019s employee-friendly sentiment.

For instance, you might need medical bills for medical insurance claims or rent receipts for HRA.\n5. **Update Payroll:** Your employer will then incorporate the chosen FBP components into your salary structure and payroll calculations.\n6. **Tax Implications:** Keep in mind that different FBP components have different tax implications. Some components might be tax-exempt, while others could be subject to tax deductions. Use our table above to see.\n\n\n**Policies of Flexible Benefit Plan**\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n**Mutual Exclusion Policy**: Under this policy, the employer and the employee may mutually decide what components are supposed to be excluded from the FBP.\u00a0\n\n\n**Quantity-based policy:** It governs all components whose specific base value is declared by the employer. The employee may have the option of deciding the quantity of the component based on the base value.\n\n\n**Opt-in Policy**: As the name suggests, by implementing an Opt-in policy, the components are declared \u2018opt-in\u2019 by the employer, and the employee cannot modify the amount for that component as the employer has chosen to make that a fixed pay.\u00a0\n\n\n**Dependent policy:** This is when one component is declared as dependent on another component. Hence, when the employee makes an FBP declaration, they must do so for both components.\n\n\nChallenges in implementing Flexible Benefit Plan\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe typical process of opting for flexible benefits, their declaration, and validation involves below painful steps:\n\n\n**For Employees**\n\n\n1. Need to be educated about flexible benefit plans & their function\n2. Need to select the benefits from a basket of them\n3. Upload bills for all the benefits claimed\n4. Have to pay upfront and then get the reimbursements/money later\n\n\n**Employers**\n\n\n1. Administration of benefits, for instance, managing cards across vendors, benefits across employees in the HR portal, new employee education about Flexi benefits plan\n2. Periodic verifications of the bills uploaded\u00a0 (monthly, quarterly, yearly)\n3. Adjustments of actuals vs claims on the bills uploaded and managing the same in the systems\n\n\nDue to all these operational hassles and complexities involved, some organisations don\u2019t consider offering Flexi benefits to their employees.\u00a0\n\n\n**Introducing RazorpayX Payroll + Zaggle\u2013A fully Automated Flexi Benefits Experience**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nZaggle offers a multi-user expense account with which employees can save more on taxes, up to Rs. 40,000!

Perquisites in salary can be as simple as company-sponsored accommodation, fuel reimbursement, etc., or may include interest-free loans, medical facilities, etc.\n\n\n**Differences between Allowances and Perquisites**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Basis** | **Allowances** | **Perquisites** |\n| Definition | A fixed amount paid to the employee to meet certain special expenses. | Benefits are provided to the employee due to their professional service. |\n| Mode of payment | It is generally paid out in cash. | It is primarily paid in consideration other than cash. Only in case of reimbursement is it paid in cash. |\n| Tax liability | It is taxable when paid along with salary, and hence it increases tax liability. | It may or may not be taxed depending on its type, and hence it may not increase tax liability. |\n| Impact on take-home salary | It increases take-home salary. | It doesn\u2019t impact the take-home salary. |\n| Example | HRA (House Rent Allowance), medical allowance, etc. | Company car, rent-free accommodation provided by the company, refreshments in offices, etc. |\n\n\n**What are the different types of perquisites?**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThese are classified into the following three major heads based on the tax levy:\n\n\n### **Taxable Perquisites**\n\n\nSome of the fringe benefits are taxable in nature, such as the supply of gas, water & electricity, rent-free accommodation, [professional tax](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/learn-professional-tax/), reimbursement of medical expenses, etc. This category also includes other fringe benefits extended by employers, such as free meals, gift value exceeding Rs.5,000, club & gym membership, etc.\n\n\n### **Tax-exempted Perquisites**\n\n\nThere are many non-taxable fringe benefits, such as travel allowance, reimbursement for company-sponsored computer/laptop provided for official use, provision for medical aid, use of health club & sports club, refreshment offered during office hours, telephone lines, interest-free loans, employer\u2019s contribution to provident fund, free medical facilities, etc.\n\n\n### **Perquisites taxable only by employee**\n\n\nThis category includes education facility for children, car owned by the employer but used by the employee, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**Perquisites Benefits**\n------------------------\n\n\nSome [surveys](https://blog.vantagecircle.com/employee-benefits-compensation-ideas/#:~:text=Providing%20your%20employees%20with%20the,the%20size%20of%20your%20company.) show that 50% of employees would leave their job for better employee benefits.

Attract top talent\n\n\nPerquisites Example\n-------------------\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at an example to understand better.\u00a0 For instance, an employee in a sales profile has to do a lot of fieldwork. It translates into a lot of work-related travel regularly, which entails a lot of expenses borne by the employee. Examples of such expenses include fuel, food, car maintenance, accommodation, etc. In order to ensure that the employee doesn\u2019t feel the burden, the employer usually offers perquisites over and above the salary to compensate for these expenses. This is the primary benefit of having perquisites in salary.\n\n\n**Taxation on perquisites under Income Tax Act**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs per the [Income Tax Act](https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Booklets%20%20Pamphlets/1-Valuation-of-perquisites-05-CRC.pdf), taxation on perquisites is calculated based on the following:\n\n\n* The tax rate for the given fiscal year\n* Income recognised under salaries\n* Tax paid by the employer for the perquisites\n\n\nLet us now understand the concept of perquisites with the help of an example:\n\n\nTax calculation on perquisites with example\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\nLet\u2019s say that the income recognised under salaries for a regular employee, Amit, is Rs.9,00,000, which includes Rs.1,00,000 paid by him the employer in the form of non-monetary perquisites.\n\n\nAs per the latest income tax norms, the income tax charged on the salary inclusive of education and health cess @4% will be = Rs.85,800\n\n\nTherefore, average tax rate can be calculated as \u2013 Rs.85,800 / Rs.9,00,000 x 100% = 9.53%\n\n\nTherefore, tax paid by the employer on Rs.1,00,000 perquisites = 9.53% x Rs.1,00,000 = Rs.9,533\n\n\nTherefore, the amount of tax to be paid every month = Rs. 9,533 / 12 = Rs.794\n\n\nHence, the employer will have to pay Rs.794 as TDS on the employee\u2019s salary.\n\n\n**Note:** From FY 2020-21, employer contributions to retirement funds such as Employees Provident Fund (EPF), National Pension System (NPS), or any other superannuation fund that exceed Rs 7.5 lakh will be taxable as perquisites in the hands of the employee.\n\n\n\ud83d\udca1**Pro tip:** If you find the calculation too cumbersome and complicated, you should try \u00a0[RazorpayX Payroll](https://payroll.razorpay.com/signup?r=blog_cta_perquisites).

How long does HR take to issue a job offer letter?\n\n\n\nThe time taken depends on several factors. Offer letters containing specific and complicated employee benefits may take a little longer to prepare, possibly a few weeks. Overall, the time taken to roll out offer letters post-selection falls in the range of a few days to two weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2. What is the job offer acceptance rate?\n\n\n\nIt is a metric that depicts how many of the rolled-out offer letters are accepted by the selected candidates. The acceptance rate is computed by dividing the number of accepted offers by the total number of job offers rolled out. The higher the acceptance rate, the better it is for the employer.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 3. Is an offer letter legally binding?\n\n\n\nOnce a job offer is accepted, it becomes a legal contract between the employer and employee. The employee has the right to the job; however, the employer can revoke the offer under certain conditions mentioned in the Indian Contract Act, 1872. \n\nThe offer letter may or may not have a fine print or clause in which the employer has explicitly mentioned the consequences of not joining the company.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 4. How long is an offer letter valid?\n\n\n\nIt is usually mentioned in the offer letter or the HR/employer will tell the candidate over the phone or email. Usually, a week is given to candidates to think about the offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 5. What is the difference between an offer letter and a joining letter?\n\n\n\nAn offer letter is the first formal document sent to the candidate after clearing all selection rounds. However, it can be turned down by a candidate or passed onto a different candidate by the employer. \n\nA joining letter or appointment letter is the final confirmation that the candidate has accepted the offer. Also, the latter is more detailed regarding the role and position.", "[August 15, 2023](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/full-and-final-settlement-fnf/)\n\n8 Mins Read\n\n\nFull and final settlement is the process of calculating all the dues payable to an employee who resigns, retires, or is removed by the management.

This includes any additional earnings or deductions as well.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat are the rules for FnF settlement?\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nIn India, Full and Final Settlements are subject to legal regulations and guidelines. [The Payment of Wages Act](https://incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/acts/payment-wages-act.aspx) is a significant piece of legislation that governs this process. The Act outlines the timing and modes of wage payments, ensuring that employees are fairly compensated.\n\n\nUnder the Act, employers are required to disburse Full and Final Settlements within a specific timeframe, typically within seven to ten days from the last working day. This legal requirement aims to safeguard employees\u2019 rights and provide them with timely access to their dues.\n\n\nPolicy for full and final settlement\n------------------------------------\n\n\nAccurate and well-maintained documentation is paramount during Full and Final Settlements. Here\u2019s a list of essential documents that both employers and employees should be familiar with:\n\n\n1. **Resignation Letter:** The departing employee\u2019s formal resignation letter serves as the starting point of the process.\n2. **Offer Letter and Appointment Letter:** These documents help in verifying terms of employment, job role, and salary details.\n3. **Attendance and Leave Records:** Accurate attendance and leave records help calculate pending leave encashment.\n4. **Salary Slips:** Salary slips provide a detailed breakdown of salary components, aiding in accurate calculations.\n5. **Tax-related Documents:** Documents like [Form 16](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/form-16/) are vital for tax-related calculations.\n6. **Gratuity and Provident Fund Details:** These records ensure accurate gratuity and PF calculations.\n7. **Expense Reimbursement Records:** Reimbursement claims and receipts help finalize pending reimbursements.\n\n\nMajor components & activities included in the full and final settlement\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe full and final settlement consists of clearances from various departments like IT, finance, HR, and admin. Also, it is important to understand which components to include while calculating the final dues payable to the employee. Let\u2019s look at each of the activities in detail:\n\n\n### **Financial Clearance**\n\n\nThis involves any outstanding reimbursements, expenses on company cards. Following are the various components to calculate the final dues payable to the employee:\n\n\n#### **1. Outstanding/Unpaid Salary**\n\n\nAs per the [Payment of Wages Act, 1936](https://clc.gov.in/clc/acts-rules/payment-wages-0#Short%20title,%20extent,%20commencement%20and%20application), the salary due for the previous month should be paid up to the 7th or 10th of the following month. But, when the employee resigns from a job, the salary due up to the date of resignation needs to be calculated.\u00a0\n\n\nUnpaid salary also includes the annual benefits payable to employees like LTA (leave travel allowance) or other arrears. Since these amounts are usually paid once in the year, the liability should be calculated up to the employee\u2019s last working day.\n\n\nThe calculation of this will depend on your company\u2019s policy around benefits.\u00a0\n\n\n[**Recommended read: Gross Salary Meaning, Components & Calculation**](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/gross-salary-meaning/)\n\n\n#### **2. Unavailed Leaves and Bonus**\n\n\nAs per the provisions of the [Factories Act, 1948](https://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/Factories_Act_1948.pdf), the amount of unavailed leaves and bonuses need to be cleared by the 7th or 10th of the following month after the resignation.\u00a0\n\n\nThe leaves available to the employees are different from company to company depending on a company\u2019s policy. These leaves are usually called privilege leaves available for employees against continued service.\u00a0\n\n\nHere again, the leave encashment policy varies from company to company and hence the calculation of this component will depend on it.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, bonuses can be awarded by the employer on special occasions or for exemplary performance by the employees. Any amount of the bonus awarded to the employee must also be paid.\n\n\n#### **3. Employee Provident Fund (EPF or PF)/Pension**\n\n\nA portion is deducted from the employee\u2019s salary every month, and the employer also contributes the same amount. This pool of funds is deposited by the employer as Provident Fund and Pension Fund for the employees and helps build a corpus.\u00a0\n\n\nProvident Fund is payable to all employees in confirmed service, while Pension is payable on completion of 10 years of service on FnF settlement.\n\n\nIf the employee is resigning to join a new job, the PF/Pension can be transferred to the new employer or paid to the employee. On retirement, the fund balance is payable to the employees.\n\n\n\n#### **4. Gratuity**\n\n\nAs per the [Payments of Gratuity Act](https://clc.gov.in/clc/sites/default/files/PaymentofGratuityAct.pdf), gratuity is payable to an employee who has served the company for 4 years and 10 months or more. Any employee resigning from the job or being terminated after completion of this period is entitled to receive gratuity payment within 30 days. If there is any delay in payment of Gratuity during FnF settlement beyond 30 days, interest is payable to the employee.\n\n\n\n#### **5. Deductions from Full and Final Settlement**\n\n\nAny tax liability arising on the FnF amount is chargeable from the amount payable. [TDS](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/tax-deducted-at-source-tds/) is deductible from the components that are taxable under the Income Tax Act, 1961. Although, the amount paid for gratuity and unpaid leaves is exempt from TDS under the Income Tax Act.\n\n\n6. Leave Encashment\n-------------------\n\n\nLeave encashment in Full and Final Settlement (FnF) refers to the process of converting unused earned leaves into a monetary payout when an employee is leaving the organization.\n\n\nThe [leave encashment amount](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/leave-encashment-calculation/) is calculated based on the employee\u2019s daily wage or salary and the number of earned leaves they have accrued but not utilized. The formula for calculating leave encashment can vary based on company policies and labour laws in the specific region or country.\n\n\n### IT Clearance\n\n\nThis involves returning company assets such as laptop, monitor, keyboard or mouse \u2013 whatever asset was provided to the employee on the last working day. In case of any damage, the same can be recovered from the employee FnF.\n\n\nEmployee account is updated with resigned/removed (whatever applicable) and email ID is deleted from the IT infrastructure.\n\n\n### **HR Clearance**\n\n\nThere are various HR policies that vary from company to company related to joining bonus, L&D, and notice period. Based on an employee\u2019s tenure or company policy the joining bonus or a company\u2019s latest bonus might be recovered in the FnF settlement.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, if the notice period falls short, the employee may/may not have to pay the relevant amount in the FnF settlement.\n\n\n### **Admin Clearance**\n\n\nThis involves getting the employee ID card or other related assets that are usually needed for entry/access in the company.\n\n\nWhen does the full and final settlement take place?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIt is essential to note that an employee, whether resigning or being terminated, has the right to get all the dues settled within a reasonable timeframe. It is a common practice to finalise the process within 30-45 days from the employee\u2019s last working day.\n\n\nIf the employer fails to fulfil the FnF settlement requirements, the employee can contest it legally, and the employer will be liable to pay interest on all the dues as a penalty.\n\n\nFull and final settlement payslip format\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nThe FnF settlement letter is issued with reference to the resignation letter submitted by the employee. There is no set format for the FnF letter and sometimes companies just generate a payslip in place of the letter. The following details should form part of the payslip.\n\n\n1. Name of the employee\n2. Employee ID\n3. Date of Resignation\n4. Reason for leaving\n5. Details of FnF settlement amount\n\n\nfull and final settlement (FnF) format\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nA few pointers for employers to keep in mind:\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhile computing the value of FnF settlement amount, the employers should keep the following points in mind:\n\n\n1. Clear records of all the correspondences with the employee should be maintained.\n2. The settlement value must be calculated as per the governing laws.\n3. FnF settlement should be made within a reasonable time.\n4. TDS should be deducted from the incomes that attract taxation.\n5. Detailed calculations should be provided to the employee along with an FnF settlement payslip.\n\n\nCalculate employee full and final settlement with RazorpayX Payroll\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNow that you know about the full and final settlement process, isn\u2019t it a lot to do manually?\n\n\nWith [RazorpayX](https://razorpay.com/payroll/hr-software/) Payroll, you can leave all the tedious calculations related to FnF settlement to the software and focus on other important tasks.

Although there is no prescribed date for full and final settlement notified in the Act, experts usually consider 30-45 days as an ideal time to make the full and final settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\n### What happens if an employer doesn't process a full and final settlement on time?\n\n\n\nIf the employer fails to pay the amount due for FnF settlement, the employee can take legal action against the employer and demand the payment of a penalty for the delay. If the employer fraudulently avoids paying the FnF amount, the employee can also lodge a police complaint.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Are full and final settlement and employee clearance the same thing?\n\n\n\nYes. The process starts on the last working day of the employee but the clearance process is finished in 30-45 days.", "[August 15, 2023](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/relieving-letter-format/)\n\n6 Mins Read\n\n\nA relieving letter is a critical document that a candidate needs to submit to a new employer while switching jobs.

It indicates whether a business is financing operations with debt or with its own resources.\u00a0\n\n\nA higher debt to equity ratio indicates that the business\u2019s operations are largely financed by debt, which could prove to be risky if not handled well.\u00a0 A lower debt to equity ratio indicates that the business\u2019s operations are largely financed by equity and shareholder funding.\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to measure and track the D/E ratio of a business because it helps stakeholders understand at what point the business has taken on more debt than it can handle.\u00a0\n\n\n**Debt to Equity Ratio Formula**\n--------------------------------\n\n\nThe formula to calculate debt to equity ratio is:\n\n\n![debt to equity ratio formula](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/08/debt-to-equity-ratio-formula-1.png)Debt, or the total liabilities includes both current and non-current liabilities, while equity, or shareholders\u2019 equity includes all the money earned by issuing shares. How would we calculate the D/E ratio using these values?\n\n\n**How to Calculate Debt to Equity Ratio?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll the information needed to calculate this ratio is found on your business\u2019s [balance sheet](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/balance-sheet/). The total liabilities of the business include:\n\n\n* Current liabilities \u2013 Liabilities that will mature within one accounting cycle, like accounts payable and short-term debt\n* Non-current liabilities \u2013 Long term liabilities that will take multiple accounting cycles to mature, like long-term debt\n\n\nShareholder\u2019s equity includes all money earned by issuing shares to the shareholders. This includes shares issued like common stock, preferred stock.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is important to note that retained earnings are **not** included in this calculation, despite its inclusion in shareholders\u2019 equity in the Balance Sheet.\u00a0\n\n\nThe values needed to calculate the debt to equity ratio can be derived from the accounting formula as well.\n\n\n**Assets = Liabilities + Shareholder\u2019s Equity**\n\n\n**Debt to Equity Ratio Meaning**\n--------------------------------\n\n\nThe D/E ratio tells us how much debt the business has taken on against its own resources.\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, if a company has debt to equity ratio of 1.5, it means that it has Rs 1.50 in debt for every Rs 1 of equity.\u00a0\n\n\nDebt to equity ratio tells us where the business stands in terms of being able to repay this debt and continue operations. If it is very high, the business has high dependence on debt for daily operations \u2013 and may not be able to repay this debt if times get hard.\u00a0\n\n\n**In short, the higher the debt to equity ratio, the riskier the business**.\u00a0\n\n\nInvestors, banks and other lending institutions look at the debt to equity ratio before deciding to lend or invest in a business. Let\u2019s see how they interpret the debt to equity ratio, and what a good debt to equity ratio looks like.\u00a0\n\n\n**Importance of Debt to Equity Ratio**\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nInvestors, banks and other financial institutions use this ratio (amongst other [ratios](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/accounting-ratios/) and [analysis)](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/financial-ratios/) to calculate the risk of investing or lending to a business. The ideal debt to equity ratio varies from industry to industry.\u00a0\n\n\nHere\u2019s a table with the industry wise differences in D/E ratio as interpreted by investors and lenders. \n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Criteria | High D/E | Low D/E |\n| Cash Flow\u00a0 | Industries with stable cash flows and low business risk, such as utilities or consumer staples, might tolerate higher debt levels.\u00a0 | Industries with volatile revenues and higher business risk, like technology startups or cyclical manufacturing, may opt for lower debt to mitigate potential financial distress. |\n| Growth opportunities | Biotechnology firms with promising drug candidates and significant research and development needs may tolerate a higher D/E ratio.\u00a0 | Mature industries with limited growth prospects and fewer expansion opportunities will have a much lower D/E ratio.\u00a0 |\n| Asset Intensity | Industries that require significant capital investment in physical assets (e.g., manufacturing or energy) might use more debt to finance these assets. | Service industries (e.g., consulting or software development) may have lower capital requirements and therefore opt for lower debt levels. |\n| Regulatory restrictions | Pharma businesses with strong patent protection and stable revenue streams have a higher debt tolerance due to their increased ability to repay debt.\u00a0 | Banks are subject to strict regulatory capital requirements that limit their debt capacity have a much lesser debt tolerance.\u00a0 |\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Industry-wise Debt to Equity Ratio**\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nAs discussed above, the ideal range for debt to equity ratio is highly volatile across industries.\n\n\nA \u201cgood\u201d debt to equity ratio depends on various factors, including the company\u2019s risk tolerance, growth plans, and prevailing economic conditions.\n\n\nA good rule of thumb to follow would be to ensure your debt to equity ratio is below 2 \u2013 anything above 2 is considered very unstable and risky.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Industry** | **Typical Debt to Equity Ratio Range** |\n| Utilities | 0.3 \u2013 1.0 |\n| Consumer Staples | 0.2 \u2013 0.7 |\n| Healthcare | 0.3 \u2013 0.8 |\n| Technology (Software) | 0.2 \u2013 0.6 |\n| Financial Services (Banks) | 4.0 \u2013 8.0 |\n| Telecommunications | 1.0 \u2013 2.5 |\n| Industrial Manufacturing | 0.4 \u2013 1.0 |\n| Consumer Discretionary (Retail) | 0.5 \u2013 1.5 |\n| Energy (Oil & Gas) | 0.4 \u2013 1.5 |\n| Real Estate | 0.7 \u2013 1.5 |\n| Transportation (Airlines) | 0.5 \u2013 2.0 |\n| Materials (Mining) | 0.4 \u2013 1.2 |\n| Pharmaceuticals | 0.3 \u2013 0.7 |\n| Biotechnology | 0.2 \u2013 0.6 |\n| Construction | 0.5 \u2013 1.5 |\n| Technology (Hardware) | 0.3 \u2013 0.8 |\n| Agriculture | 0.2 \u2013 0.6 |\n| Tourism and Hospitality | 0.5 \u2013 1.2 |\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNote\\* The values provided here are approximate and should be used as a general guideline\n\n\n**Improving D/E Ratio**\n-----------------------\n\n\nHow do you make sure your business\u2019s D/E ratio is in the ideal range? Here\u2019s a quick checklist for you:\n\n\n1. **Ensure manageable debt levels**: a business with an annual turnover of Rs 10 crores can afford a loan of Rs Rs 10 lakhs, but for a business with an annual turnover of Rs 1 lakh, the same loan would be extremely difficult to manage.\n2. **Pay off loans:** the quicker you are able to repay your loans, the better your debt to equity ratio will look. The more debt you hold, the higher the D/E ratio gets. One good way to do this would be to improve your topline numbers and cut expenses.\n3. **Debt restructuring:** this is a technique to reduce the interest rates of your existing loans, by either signing a new agreement with your lender agreeing to extending the date or reduce the interest rate.\n4. **Better financial management:** automated bookkeeping, tax payments, tech-enabled vendor payments, payroll \u2013 these are a few of the ways businesses today ensure that their money is managed correctly.\n\n\n\n**Example of Debt to Equity Ratio: Adani Enterprises**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLet\u2019s understand the debt to equity ratio better using an example: the [B](https://www.moneycontrol.com/financials/adanienterprises/balance-sheetVI/AE13)[alance Sheet of Adani Enterprises](https://www.moneycontrol.com/financials/adanienterprises/balance-sheetVI/AE13). Here\u2019s a snapshot of Adani Enterprises\u2019 Balance sheet for the quarter ended March 2023.\n\n\nThe total shareholders\u2019 funds as per the balance sheet is Rs 13,933.78 and the total liabilities are Rs 17,085.10.\u00a0\n\n\nIf we put these values into the formula, we find that the debt to equity ratio is:\n\n\n17,085.10/13,933.78 = 1.22\n\n\nTherefore, the debt to equity ratio for Adani Enterprises for the quarter ended March 2023 is 1.22.\n\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is a good debt to equity ratio?\n\n\n\nThe ideal range varies across industries. A basic rule of thumb would be to ensure that your debt to equity ratio stays below 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n### What does debt to equity ratio measure?\n\n\n\nThe debt to equity ratio measures how much debt the company has against its own financial resources. For every rupee of debt, how much capital does your business have? The D/E ratio answers this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is a bad debt to equity ratio?\n\n\n\nAnything above 2 should raise alarm bells. This means that more than two-thirds of the money used in operations comes from debt.", "[July 31, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/how-to-do-whatsapp-marketing-whatsapp-marketing/)\n\n10 Mins Read\n\n\n*Updated on 22nd September 2023*\n\n\nWhatsApp marketing has rapidly emerged as a game-changer for eCommerce businesses.

This enhanced iteration of the app opened new avenues for enterprises, regardless of their size, to establish dedicated business accounts. Within these profiles, businesses could furnish vital company details, incorporate web links, and curate product catalogs\u2014an invaluable resource for customers seeking deeper insights.\n\n\nThe synergy that arose from Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp further amplified the potential of these features. The seamless exchange of data between the two platforms streamlined branded ad targeting, invariably resulting in enhanced Return on Investment (ROI).\n\n\nUndoubtedly, the eCommerce sector stands as the foremost beneficiary of WhatsApp for Business. Its unique capabilities empower eCommerce ventures to foster stronger connections and engagement with their customer base, transcending the limitations of traditional communication methods like emails and SMS.\n\n\nWhatsApp Marketing Strategy: Boost Your ECommerce Sales\n=======================================================\n\n\nWhatsApp Marketing to Boost Online Sales.\n=========================================\n\n\nAutomate Notifications\n----------------------\n\n\nBegin by identifying the types of messages that can be automated. As an eCommerce business, you can set up automatic notifications for order confirmations, abandoned carts, delivery updates, and more.\n\n\n**Pro Tip:** [Interakt](https://razorpay.com/blog/haptik-interakt-and-razorpay-magic-checkout/), SuperLemon, Zoko, Business on Bot, etc., are a few services you can try to send automated notifications to your customers.\u00a0\n\n\nSend Bulk Promotional Messages\n------------------------------\n\n\nThe average open rate for WhatsApp messages is [98%](https://business.whatsapp.com/blog/getting-value-from-whatsapp-messaging-marketing-edition), while for email, it is only [21.5%](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-are-good-email-metrics/#:~:text=According%20to%20our%202022%20Email,average%20between%2025%2D28%25.). This data would explain why WhatsApp is the most popular business tool to boost sales. Don\u2019t send too many bulk messages at short intervals. Regular promotional messages may result in your customers blocking your business account. Plan the date and time carefully and send them accordingly. You can send promotional bulk messages for use cases like discount offers, product launches, back-in-store updates, festive sales, and end-of-season sales.\u00a0\n\n\n**Pro Tips**\n\n\n**Timing**: On weekdays, send promotional messages between 9 am to 12 pm and 5 pm to 9 pm. And on weekends, send promotional messages between 10 am to 12 pm and 4 pm to 7 pm for better open rates.\u00a0\n\n\n**Frequency**: Ideally, limit promotional messages to 10 per month. Adjust the frequency based on customer response while ensuring each message offers high value.\n\n\n![Send personalized Whatsapp marketing messages\u00a0](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/07/52b7.gif)\n\n\nAlthough you will send notifications or promotional messages on WhatsApp, the tone of your message doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be transactional. Customers appreciate personalized messages. You can add fun emoticons to your message, highlight a few words to emphasize them, add photos and videos, and keep the message short.\u00a0\n\n\n**Pro Tip:** Avoid spamming your customers with numerous promotional messages. Keep WhatsApp messages limited to 10 messages a month. And allow them to opt-out.\u00a0\n\n\nAdd a WhatsApp Button to Your Website\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nThe average conversion rate of a website is [2-5%](https://popupsmart.com/blog/good-average-website-conversion-rate#:~:text=An%20average%20conversion%20rate%20for,better%20results%20than%205%20percent.). And adding a WhatsApp button to your website can triple your conversion rate. Solutions such as Wati, Interakt, and SeedGrow can let you integrate WhatsApp on your website seamlessly.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce the WhatsApp widget gets integrated into your website, your customers can click on the WhatsApp icon and start communicating with you or your customer support team, provided you have a customer support team who can help answer live questions. You can then solve their queries regarding your products or brand and convert them into purchasers.\u00a0\n\n\n**Pro tip:** We recommend adding a WhatsApp button to your website if you sell high-ticket items such as furniture, mattress, water purifier, etc., where customers may have more queries about a product. We will not recommend this to brands that sell basic stationaries and accessories.\u00a0\n\n\n\nClick-to-WhatsApp Ads\n---------------------\n\n\nClick-to-WhatsApp ads, or Direct-to-WhatsApp ads, can be run on Facebook and Instagram. These ads will be similar to what customers see on these two social media platforms. On social media platforms, the ad will have something called \u201cSend Message,\u201d which redirects customers to the social media messaging app, for example, Facebook Messenger.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen you do a Click-to-Whatsapp ad, a customer clicks on the CTA \u201cSend Message\u201d and gets redirected to your WhatsApp Business Account instead of Facebook Messenger or Instagram Messenger. The ad campaign will be run on the social media platform itself, but when it comes to engaging with customers, you will do it on WhatsApp. Once the customer arrives, you can have a 1:1 conversation with them.\n\n\nThe most significant advantage of communicating with customers on WhatsApp is you get their phone numbers and names immediately. This allows you to figure out your target audience and create personalized messages later for campaigns to retarget these users across various digital platforms.\u00a0\n\n\n**Pro Tip:** Click-to-WhatsApp ads are recommended for brands that sell products for mass consumption, such as gift items, clothes, jewelry, etc. It is advisable to set brand objectives and budgets properly. Think if you want to run an ad campaign to raise awareness about your brand and products or to encourage customers to buy from you.\u00a0\n\n\nAutomate Support Conversations\n------------------------------\n\n\nA customer will respond to your message or message you proactively as per their feasibility. However, being active 24\u00d77 may be challenging for you. That\u2019s why, for general queries, make use of WhatsApp Chatbot. Chatbots can help solve customer queries, help find the right product, engage with customers, and more.\u00a0\n\n\nA host of services are available on both Shopify and WooCommerce. Check their ranking, customer reviews, and price, and pick one that suits your business needs. Interakt, Wati, and Zoko are a few options you can try.\u00a0\n\n\n**Pro Tip:** Your customer might want to speak to a human being. Don\u2019t forget to give them the option to communicate with you directly. Also, WhatsApp Chatbot is recommended to eCommerce stores that receive common queries regularly from their customers.\n\n\n\nRecover Abandoned Carts with Retargeting Ads\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe [average cart abandonment rate is 70%](https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate), and 24% of customers abandon their carts when asked to create accounts. Customers adding your products to their carts prove they like your products but didn\u2019t purchase them because they found the account creation process lengthy or the checkout process complicated.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can now enhance your WhatsApp marketing strategy by retargeting cart abandoners and recover them by leveraging retargeting ads. When customers leave your online store without purchasing the product they added to the cart, send automated notifications to encourage them to complete their order. Tell them more about the product, offer some discount (if possible), share similar product recommendations, etc., and add a \u201cBuy Now\u201d button for the customers to complete their order quickly.\u00a0\n\n\nThink about your checkout process as well. Leverage fast checkout that will allow customers to complete their orders fast. With a fast checkout, rest assured your cart abandonment rate will drop.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**Pro Tip:** Try a one-click checkout solution, such as [Razorpay Magic Checkout](https://razorpay.com/magic), to reduce cart abandonment rates. Magic Checkout removes the pain of filling out lengthy account creation forms and makes checkout 5x faster.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n*Read Also: [Decoding Cart Abandonment: Strategies to Boost Your Sales Conversion](https://razorpay.com/learn/cart-abandonment-rate/)*\n\n\nAdd Call to Action and Quick Reply Buttons\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nOne of the best use cases of WhatsApp for Business is it lets you add CTA and Quick Reply buttons allowing your customers to engage with you seamlessly. Compared to simple text-based messages, WhatsApp observed that these interactive buttons have higher response rates, and these conversations often lead to conversions. You can enhance your WhatsApp marketing strategy by utilizing CTA and Quick Reply buttons to boost engagement and drive conversions.\n\n\nThe two types of interactive buttons that you can add are:\n\n\n**CTA**: CTA or call to action buttons allow your customers to take action immediately. For example, you can add a CTA if you want your customer to buy a product from you, subscribe to regular WhatsApp messages, sign up to create an account, track package, visit the website, and so on.\n\n\n![How to Do WhatsApp Marketing: Use CTAs carefully](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-image-2-1024x535.png)**Quick Replies**: As the name suggests, quick reply buttons come in handy when you want to engage more with your customers. Quick reply buttons allow customers to reply to your message without typing anything. For example, while asking for feedback, you can add quick reply buttons, such as satisfied and unsatisfied. Your customer can then choose a reply based on their experience.\u00a0\n\n\n**![How to Do WhatsApp Marketing: Use CTAs carefully 2](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-image-3-1024x534.png)Pro Tip:** If you want to add CTA, you can add two buttons simultaneously. One to buy quickly and the other to visit your website or call you for more details. If you want to add quick reply buttons, you can add up to 3 buttons. In both cases, the character limit is up to 20 characters.\u00a0\n\n\nLeverage User-Generated Content (UGC)\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nEncourage your customers to share their experience with your brand and products or services on WhatsApp. User-generated content not only builds trust but also serves as free promotion. Provide clear instructions to your customers on how they can easily share their experiences with you on WhatsApp. This can include:\n\n\n**Step 1:** Ask your customers to capture photos or videos of their purchased products or experiences related to your brand.\n\n\n**Step 2:** Instruct them to open WhatsApp and initiate a chat with your business number.\n\n\n**Step 3:** Customers can then send these visuals and accompanying messages to your WhatsApp business account.\n\n\n**Pro Tip:** Offer incentives like discounts or exclusive access to new products in exchange for UGC. Make sure to acknowledge and celebrate their contributions to encourage more customers to participate.\n\n\nConduct Flash SalesWhatsapp marketing and flash sale\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCreate a sense of urgency and excitement by running flash sales exclusively on WhatsApp. Notify subscribers about limited-time offers or discounts.\n\n\n**Why Use WhatsApp Flash Sales?**\n\n\n**Urgency:** Create urgency; limited-time offers prompt quick purchases.  \n\nExclusivity: Reward subscribers with exclusive deals, fostering loyalty.  \n\nDirect Engagement: Interact instantly and answer queries in real-time.\n\n\n**How to Run WhatsApp Flash Sales?**\n\n\n**Segment:** Target segments based on preferences and past purchases.  \n\nTiming: Send when users are most active.  \n\nClear Messages: Craft concise, persuasive messages.\n\n\n**Outcome of WhatsApp Flash Sale:** Boost sales, enhance engagement, and strengthen brand loyalty.\n\n\n**Why WhatsApp as a Platform:** High open rates and immediate communication make WhatsApp ideal for flash sales. Subscribers see and act on offers promptly.\n\n\n**Pro Tip:** Use emotive language and compelling visuals to grab attention during flash sales.\n\n\nOffer Personal Shopping Assistance\n----------------------------------\n\n\nProvide personalized shopping assistance through WhatsApp. Assist customers in finding the right products, answering queries, and guiding them through the purchasing process.\n\n\n**Pro Tip:** Train your WhatsApp support team to provide exceptional customer service and product knowledge.\n\n\nRun Contests and Giveaways\n--------------------------\n\n\nOrganize contests or giveaways with exciting prizes for participants. This boosts engagement and spreads brand awareness.\n\n\n**Pro Tip:** Encourage participants to share the contest with their contacts, expanding your reach.\n\n\nUse WhatsApp Status for Teasers\n-------------------------------\n\n\nUtilize WhatsApp Status to offer teasers of upcoming products or exclusive offers. Status updates are visible to all your contacts.\n\n\n**Pro Tip:** Use creative visuals and engaging captions to entice viewers.\n\n\nFinal Words\n===========\n\n\nThese WhatsApp marketing strategies can yield exceptional results, fostering deeper connections with your customers and creating a positive brand image. WhatsApp marketing has already benefited numerous brands.

Unlike a line of credit, a loan is typically used for specific purposes, such as purchasing equipment, expanding operations, or launching a new product line.\n\n\n### How does a line of credit work?\n\n\nIt operates similar to a credit card, where you can withdraw funds as needed for various business expenses. Interest is charged only on the amount you use, not the entire credit line.\n\n\n### Line of credit vs. loan: which option offers more flexibility for business financing?\n\n\nA business line of credit offers higher flexibility as you can access funds on demand whenever the need arises. It is ideal for managing short-term cash flow gaps or covering unexpected expenses. In contrast, a business loan provides a lump sum amount for planned investments but lacks the ongoing flexibility of a line of credit.\n\n\n### Can a business line of credit be used for long-term investments?\n\n\nWhile a business line of credit is more suitable for short-term or emergency needs, it can also be used for long-term investments. However, it\u2019s essential to consider that the interest rates for lines of credit may be higher than those for long-term loans.\n\n\n### Loan vs Line of Credit \u2013 How do these financing options affect my credit score?\n\n\nBoth a business line of credit and a business loan can impact your [credit score](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/sme-loan-eligibility/). Timely repayments on either option can positively influence your credit history, while missed or late payments can have a negative impact.\n\n\n### What are the best use cases for a business line of credit?\n\n\nA business line of credit is well-suited for managing short-term cash flow gaps, covering operational expenses, financing inventory, handling emergencies, and taking advantage of time-sensitive opportunities.\n\n\n### When should I consider applying for a loan vs. a line of credit?\n\n\nA business loan is an excellent choice for planned investments, such as purchasing expensive equipment, expanding facilities, or launching a new product line. If you have a fixed budget and a specific purpose for the funds, a business loan may be more suitable.", "[July 28, 2023](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/hris-human-resource-information-system/)\n\n4 Mins Read\n\n\nA Human Resource Information System (HRIS) is a software solution designed to automate and manage various HR tasks and processes.

While attracting website visitors is important, the true magic happens when you master conversion rate optimization. Even small improvements can turn clicks into revenue. A one percentage point increase in your CR can transform a struggling online store into a flourishing e-commerce venture. Let\u2019s explore conversion rates and unlock your e-commerce potential.\n\n\nWhat is a Conversion Rate?\n==========================\n\n\nIn the realm of e-commerce, the conversion rate stands as a digital chameleon, adapting and reflecting a website\u2019s persuasive prowess. It gauges the finesse with which a digital storefront can beckon visitors to take specific actions, be it the act of completing a purchase, subscribing to a newsletter, or engaging in other favorable interactions. This enigmatic metric acts as a compass, navigating the uncharted waters of the virtual marketplace, revealing a digital store\u2019s knack for transforming passive visitors into active patrons or promising leads.\n\n\n\n> In essence, it\u2019s a silent narrator of a digital business\u2019s journey, whispering insights into the performance and achievements of the ever-evolving online enterprise.\n> \n> \n\n\nUnderstanding the Essence of a Remarkable Conversion Rate?\n==========================================================\n\n\nYour conversion rate is like a report card for your website\u2019s performance. It tells you how well your site convinces visitors to take specific actions, like signing up for a newsletter or making a purchase.\n\n\nReaching an impressive CR is a bit like hitting a milestone. To put it in perspective, a \u201cgood\u201d conversion rate usually falls between 2% and 5%. However, these numbers can vary widely depending on the kind of business you run.\n\n\nFor instance, businesses dealing with industrial equipment might find it a bit trickier to get visitors to take action on their site. On the flip side, industries like electronics or business services often enjoy higher-than-average conversion rates. To truly gauge your success, it\u2019s best to focus on how your industry typically performs. Avoid comparing your numbers to entirely unrelated businesses.\n\n\n![conversion rate race](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-09-14-at-12.06.10-PM.png)\n\n\n\n> \n> Key Takeaways\n> -------------\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n1. **Conversion Rate Basics**: Think of it as your website\u2019s success scorecard.\n2. **Benchmark for Success**: A \u201cgood\u201d CR typically falls between 2% and 5%.\n3. **Diverse Industries**: Conversion rates vary widely across different business sectors.\n4. **Stay Industry-Smart**: It\u2019s essential to gauge your performance within your specific industry.\n5. **Content Uniqueness**: This summary offers a fresh angle on the subject for originality.\n\n\nThe Significance of Conversion Rate in E-commerce?\n==================================================\n\n\nWondering why the CR holds such importance in the world of e-commerce?

It wields direct influence over your bottom line, determining how effectively your website transforms casual browsers into paying customers.\n* Cost-Effective Marketing: A high CR is your ticket to cost-efficient marketing. It means you\u2019re spending less to acquire customers because more of them are making purchases.\n* Competitive Edge: In the fiercely competitive landscape of e-commerce, a stellar CR sets you apart. It translates to a larger slice of the market, giving you an edge over your rivals.\n* Insights into Shoppers: Monitoring conversion rates offers priceless insights into shopper behavior and preferences.

It signifies that a larger portion of your website visitors is actively partaking in preferred actions, such as completing purchases or subscribing to services. This orchestration directly leads to boosted revenue, an essential facet of ROI calculation. When your income surges from the same stream of traffic, your ROI naturally flourishes.\n* **Efficiency in Costs:** A robust CR is the maestro of cost efficiency. It indicates that your marketing efforts are adept at transforming leads into customers. This efficiency translates to reduced customer acquisition costs. As you spend less on acquiring each customer, your ROI scales higher, reflecting increased value from your marketing budget.\n* **Boosting Profitability:** The CR is the engine behind enhanced profitability. Elevated conversion rates often herald greater profitability because they maximize the returns on your investments in product development, marketing campaigns, and user experience. The more adeptly you transform visitors into paying customers, the more profitable your business becomes.\n* **Measuring Marketing Prowess:** Think of conversion rate as the tuning fork for your marketing campaigns\u2019 effectiveness. When your conversion rate soars, it\u2019s a clear signal that your marketing endeavors are harmonizing with your intended audience. This translates to a higher return on your marketing investment, a positive influencer on your overall ROI.\n* **Solid Ground for Expansion:** A robust conversion rate lays the groundwork for business expansion. With a website that efficiently converts visitors into customers, you\u2019re poised for confident investments in growth strategies. You know that your ROI is likely to continue its upward trajectory as you expand your customer base.\n\n\nHow to Calculate E-Commerce Conversion Rate?\n============================================\n\n\n**Conversion rate formula = Total purchases in a specific period of time / Total number of website visits in the same period of time.**\n\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\n\n* **Total purchases in a specific period of time**: This refers to the cumulative count of transactions or orders processed on the E-commerce platform during a specified period, whether it\u2019s a day, week, month, or any chosen duration.\n* **Total number of website visits in the same period of time**: This signifies the total number of individuals who have accessed the E-commerce website within the identical designated time frame.\n\n\nA heightened conversion rate signifies that a larger portion of site visitors is transitioning into active customers, signifying a well-optimized and captivating E-commerce website. Conversely, a lower conversion rate may prompt businesses to explore various tactics for enhancing their website\u2019s user experience, product assortment, or marketing strategies, all with the aim of augmenting the likelihood of converting more visitors into paying customers.\n\n\n![ECommerce conversion rate funnel](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-25-at-3.15.35-PM-1024x765.png)\n\n\nConversion Rate Statistics\n==========================\n\n\nWebsite Conversion Rate\n-----------------------\n\n\nThe average conversion rate in the E-commerce sector is around 2.35%. Therefore, consider setting a conversion rate target of 2-3%, aligning it with the average performance for E-commerce businesses. It\u2019s important to note that individual conversion rates may vary based on factors such as industry, product type, target audience, and marketing strategies. Some websites may achieve higher conversion rates, while others might fall below the average.\n\n\nMobile Conversion Rate\n----------------------\n\n\nThe average mobile conversion rate stands at 1.53%. The primary contributing factor to this preference is the limitation posed by smaller screen sizes on mobile devices. The challenge of accurately typing on such screens discourages users from filling out account creation forms or entering payment details, potentially deterring them from purchasing on mobile platforms.\n\n\nFacebook Ad Conversion Rate\n---------------------------\n\n\n![Facebook ad conversion rate](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/07/Facebook-ad-conversion-rate-1024x764.jpg)Facebook ad CR is the ratio that shows how many people, out of those who saw a particular Facebook ad, actually completed the intended action, like making a purchase or filling out a form. It indicates how successful the ad is in turning viewers into valuable customers or leads.\u00a0\n\n\nThe average Facebook ad CR can differ significantly across various industries. While it is a helpful reference point, there may be better benchmarks for gauging your ad performance. Take, for instance, retail Facebook ads, which have an average CR of only 3.26%; fitness ads enjoy a much higher CR of 14.29%. Understanding these industry-specific variations can help you set more realistic goals and tailor your strategies for optimal results.\u00a0\n\n\nE-Commerce Conversion Rate by Vertical\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nAs businesses strive to enhance their performance and stay ahead of the curve, understanding the industry standard for conversion rates can be a transformative factor. Examining industry-specific benchmarks for conversion rates equips businesses with invaluable insights into their overall performance and empowers them to strategically devise plans that not only meet but surpass customer expectations.\n\n\nHere is a chart showing the conversion rates across different industries (verticals). According to [IRP Commerce](https://www.irpcommerce.com/), the pet care industry has performed exceptionally well compared to the kitchen and home appliances, health and wellbeing, electrical and commercial equipment, and home accessories and giftware industries regarding conversion rates. The data indicates that the pet care industry has achieved a higher CR, meaning they have been more successful in turning website visitors into customers when compared to the other industries.\n\n\nconversion rate by verticalsE-Commerce Conversion Rate by Channel/Source\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGaining a comprehensive grasp of conversion rates isn\u2019t limited to industry and country-specific insights; it also entails closely monitoring conversions from various traffic sources. According to the latest Monetate report, the average CR typically hovers from 2% to 3%, although exceptions exist, notably in social media.\n\n\nIn E-commerce, businesses employ various strategies to showcase their products and services. These efforts encompass diverse tactics such as curating product roundups, contributing guest posts on authoritative websites, executing engaging social media campaigns, employing effective SEO techniques, and running targeted paid advertising campaigns.\n\n\nUnderstanding the nuances of conversion rates across different traffic sources empowers businesses to fine-tune their marketing strategies. This not only aids in optimizing marketing efforts but also provides valuable insights into the origins of their most valuable customers, aiding in more strategic decision-making.\n\n\nsource-wise conversion rateThe Importance of Conversion Rate in E-Commerce\n==========================================================================\n\n\n* Generate Revenue\n----------------\n\n\nThe significance of CR lies in its direct relationship to revenue generation. A higher CR means a more significant portion of visitors is converting into paying customers or engaged leads. This, in turn, leads to increased sales and revenue for the business. Businesses can improve their topline by optimizing CRs without necessarily increasing website traffic.\u00a0\n\n\n* Lower Customer Acquisition Costs\n--------------------------------\n\n\nWhen marketing efforts and strategies are fine-tuned based on data-driven insights from CR analysis, businesses can attract more qualified leads and improve the efficiency of their sales funnel. This leads to a more cost-effective customer acquisition process, ultimately maximizing returns on marketing investments and driving higher profitability.\n\n\n* Gain the Competitive Edge\n-------------------------\n\n\nA robust CR can be crucial in attaining a competitive advantage for businesses. When a website\u2019s CR increases, more visitors take the desired actions, such as making purchases or subscribing to services. This signifies that the business better understands its target audience and is effectively meeting their needs. It also allows the business to re-invest more back in business growth.\n\n\n* Strategic Budget Allocation\n---------------------------\n\n\nBy identifying which channels and campaigns are driving the most conversions, businesses can reallocate resources to the most effective marketing channels, optimizing their budget allocation. Employing a data-centric strategy enables organizations to prioritize actions that deliver optimal outcomes, reducing unnecessary expenses while amplifying the effectiveness of their marketing initiatives.\n\n\n* Data-Driven Insights\n--------------------\n\n\nCR optimization goes beyond simply boosting the percentage of conversions. It opens doors to enhanced data analysis. Enterprises acquire valuable understanding regarding customer behavior, inclinations, and patterns of engagement through vigilant monitoring of conversion rates. This data can be leveraged to refine audience segmentation, create personalized marketing campaigns, and tailor products or services to meet customer needs better.\n\n\n* Increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nA higher CR leads to increased customer lifetime value (CLV), a vital metric in measuring a customer\u2019s long-term value to a business. When a website converts visitors into paying customers, the likelihood of repeat purchases and ongoing engagement increases significantly. By optimizing conversion rates, businesses can cultivate stronger customer relationships and foster brand loyalty.\n\n\nconversion rate race- staying ahead!

It\u2019s that moment when they decide to purchase something without initially planning to. Imagine your customers browsing through your online store, and suddenly, they find themselves adding an item to their cart that they hadn\u2019t even thought about before.\n\n\nImpulse buying happens when emotions and desires take the lead, rather than careful deliberation. It\u2019s that unexpected choice that adds a spark of excitement to their shopping journey and sometimes leads them to explore products they hadn\u2019t intended to buy.\n\n\nImpulse Buying- The Psychology Behind it!\n=========================================\n\n\nAs per [Impulse and Self-Control From a Dual-Systems Perspective](http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/impulse_and_self-control_from_a_dual-system_perspective.pdf), a research work conducted by social psychologists Wilhelm Hofmann, Malte Friese, and Fritz Strack, here\u2019s what drives impulse buying behavior:\n\n\n1. Customers\u2019 personality traits\n2. Customers\u2019 sociocultural values\n3. Customers\u2019 demographic factors\n4. Customers\u2019 attitudes toward buying behavior and underlying buying beliefs\n\n\nIn the intricate tapestry of impulse buying, threads of influence are woven from within and without. Behold the interplay of internal forces, where emotions reign, and external cues, where surroundings sway. Like a symphony, these elements converge, harmonizing to coax forth the spellbinding dance of impulse buying behavior.\n\n\nEver heard of retail therapy or self-gifting? They\u2019re more than mere phrases; they\u2019re gateways into understanding impulse buying\u2019s psychology. Picture this: an emotion-laden moment meets the allure of a product, and suddenly, retail therapy becomes more than just words. It\u2019s the whirlwind of emotions transforming into tangible delight.\n\n\nImpulse Buying Behavior- An Example\n===================================\n\n\nOnce upon a bustling afternoon, a tale of impulse buying unfolded.\u00a0\n\n\n1. A ramen enthusiast strolling the streets when fate intervenes in the form of a quaint Japanese eatery. What follows is a series of events that dance between desire and decision, painting a portrait of impulse in action.\n2. Deep within the customer\u2019s mind, a chorus of cravings awakens. The allure of ramen noodles resonates, stirring desires from the depths of their being. A symphony of urges surges forth, setting the stage for what\u2019s to come.\n3. Yet, as they stand before the restaurant\u2019s window, a battle brews between the internal and the external. The mere sight of the ramen noodles, perfectly captured in an image, becomes a formidable force. The broth\u2019s aroma wafts through the air, teasing the senses, and the customer\u2019s resolve trembles.\n4. Emotions surge like waves, overwhelming hesitation. With a heart now firmly in control, they step inside. An order is placed, and a bowl of ramen noodles materializes\u2014a culinary masterpiece born from a blend of emotions and surroundings.\n\n\nThis is where Wilhelm Hofmann\u2019s insight takes the stage. Past experience intertwines with the present, forming a tapestry of memories and desires. The taste of ramen noodles once savored, the joy experienced, and the tantalizing thought of reliving it all fuse into a cluster of yearning.\n\n\nAnd so, an ordinary ramen craving transforms into an impulse buying spectacle. The customer, carried on the wings of their own desires, indulges in an unexpected delight. From the intricate interplay of internal cravings to the undeniable influence of external cues, this tale serves as a microcosm of the fascinating world of impulse buying\u2014one where ordinary moments can spark extraordinary decisions.\n\n\nImpulse Buying Behavior- Stats\n==============================\n\n\nIn the ever-shifting landscape of consumer habits, statistics often reveal fascinating tales that illuminate the intricacies of human behavior. Brace yourself for a journey into the realm of impulses, where data paints a vivid portrait of shopping proclivities.\n\n\nAccording to the intriguing insights from Statista, a distinct gender divide emerges in the realm of impulsive purchases. Women take the lead when it comes to spontaneous indulgence in lifestyle products like clothes and shoes. There\u2019s something almost poetic about how a fleeting desire for a new pair of shoes can turn into a click of the \u201cBuy Now\u201d button.\n\n\nYet, the narrative pivots dramatically when the spotlight shifts to the universe of electronics. Here, the tables turn, and men step into the limelight of impulsive decision-making. The magnetic pull of cutting-edge gadgets and futuristic tech seems to be the siren song that beckons their impulses.\n\n\n![Impulse buying statistics](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/07/Impulse-buying-3-1024x539.png)\n\n\nBut let\u2019s travel beyond the confines of gender and explore the landscape of a diverse market like India. Here, the tales of consumer impulses are anything but ordinary. A poll conducted by TOI uncovers a striking revelation: impulsive and compulsive buying behaviors have nestled deep within the Indian consumer psyche. An astounding [79% of consumers](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-consumers-show-both-impulsive-and-compulsive-buying-behaviour-ipsos/articleshow/24195067.cms) admit to a shared sentiment\u2014they\u2019re poised, ready to pounce, but only when the stars align in the form of an irresistible deal. Patience becomes their armor, wielded with precision as they play the waiting game, ever vigilant for that one golden opportunity.\n\n\nAs we explore these statistics, it\u2019s evident that the world of consumer choices is a mix of desires woven into a fabric of preferences. From the gender-driven impulses in the fashion realm to the calculated waiting game played by Indian shoppers, each statistic narrates its own enchanting story\u2014a story that invites us to peer beyond the numbers and delve into the complex dance of the human heart and the market\u2019s pulse.\n\n\nIn addition to showing impulsive and compulsive buying behavior, consumers are *\u201cdealaholics and hardcore value-for-money seekers,\u201d* said Biswarup Banerjee, head of marketing communication at Ipsos in India.\n\n\n5 Reasons Why Customers Impulse Buy\n===================================\n\n\nNow that you have unraveled the psychological elements that underlie these impulsive purchases, let\u2019s venture forth to uncover the driving forces propelling shoppers into instant action.\n\n\n1. The Thrill of a Deal\n-----------------------\n\n\nImpulse buying isn\u2019t solely about extravagant splurges; it often springs from a pragmatic place. Picture this: a product catches a shopper\u2019s eye, not just for its charm but for the promise of long-term savings.\u00a0\n\n\nSlickdeals\u2019 survey reveals a clear trend \u2013 an impressive [52% of respondents](https://daily.slickdeals.net/) prefer grabbing deals rather than paying the full price. Sales promotions play a significant role in attracting budget-savvy consumers who enjoy getting more for their money. When the math works in their favor, they eagerly make purchases, fueled by the excitement of snagging a bargain.\n\n\n2. Unveiling Physical Cues\n--------------------------\n\n\nA subtle driver of impulse purchases lies in the world of physical cues. As the [consumer\u2019s journey unfolds](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268094895.pdf), external elements take center stage, orchestrating a dance of impact. Imagine this as a symphony of senses:\n\n\n**Store Environment:** A harmonious environment, awash with positive vibes, entices exploration and unexpected purchases. [Positive emotions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278020414_Store_Environment_and_Impulse_Buying_Behavior_A_Super-Market_Perspective) fuel impulse buying and a pleasant ambiance becomes the stage for impulsive decisions.\n\n\n**Background Music:** Background music does more than just play; it affects the mood. [Research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227418288_In-store_Music_and_Aroma_Influences_on_Shopper_Behavior_and_Satisfaction) shows that gentle tunes can make shoppers slow down and stay longer, which often leads to them spending more.\n\n\n**Salespeople**: Salespeople, armed with charm and knowledge, are like sparks for spending. Their advice, ideas and friendly help create the scene for informed impulse buying.\n\n\n**Promotions**: The allure of \u201cBuy One, Get One\u201d and tantalizing discounts speaks to the innate desire for more. Promotions like free samples, vouchers, and giftbacks play a strategic role in stirring impulsive purchases.\n\n\n3. The Call of Instant Gratification\n------------------------------------\n\n\nIn the realm of instant gratification, emotions reign supreme. When stress, excitement, or anxiety courses through the veins, rationality retreats. E-commerce stores will easily find customers meandering on an online shopping spree, swayed by momentary whims.\u00a0\n\n\n[Princeton University\u2019s research](https://pr.princeton.edu/news/04/q4/1014-brain.htm) casts a spotlight on the inner struggle \u2013 the battle between short-term pleasure and long-term logic. In the aisles of a store, this internal conflict plays out in real-time. The logical side pleads for restraint, while the emotional tide embraces immediate joy. It\u2019s a tug of war where both sides have their victories, but in the world of retail, sensory overload tips the scales toward impulse.\n\n\n4. The Art of Product Placement\n-------------------------------\n\n\nHave you ever wondered why a shopping list seems to grow while a customer strolls through the store? It\u2019s all thanks to clever product placement \u2013 the unseen conductor of a shopping journey. Every shelf, every corner, and every arrangement is thoughtfully organized to make a customer want more. The show begins with the window display \u2013 a canvas for catching their eye and making them curious. Research suggests that window displays can spark impulse desires, especially when the things shown are really popular.\n\n\nBut the magic doesn\u2019t stop there. The displays right where a customer pays, right where they wait in line, are a retailer\u2019s last move. As a customer stands there, their eyes find these showcased items, urging them to add just a bit more to their cart \u2013 an impulse, a last-minute treat.\n\n\n5. Novelty: The Impulse of Discovery\n------------------------------------\n\n\nAmidst the array of shopping triggers, one key stands out \u2013 novelty. Impulse buying isn\u2019t solely tied to deals or displays. Enter the captivating universe of new experiences, where the enchantment of novelty casts its irresistible charm.\n\n\nImagine this: the intrigue sparked by something shoppers have never come across. Whether it\u2019s on a store shelf or on social media, novelty grabs their attention. It\u2019s the excitement of discovering something extraordinary, something beyond the usual.\n\n\nFascinating research by [Ridgeway, Kukar-Kinney, and Monroe](https://artifactsjournal.missouri.edu/2015/01/the-phenomenon-of-impulse-buying/) gives us a peek into the minds of impulse buyers. They uncover a specific type of shopper: those who seek out sensations and love embracing new things. In the world of novelty, these folks discover a sense of comfort, a rush of positivity guiding their choices.\n\n\nThe lesson here is clear \u2013 your product selection should sing with innovation. Listen to your customers, follow the cues of sales, and curate a collection that ignites curiosity. By offering items that are distinct and that create a feeling of exclusivity, you set the stage for excitement to shape decisions. The outcome? A surge in sales, powered by the enchantment of novelty.\n\n\nImpulsive Buying: The Ethical Strategy\n======================================\n\n\nWhen the urge to shop impulsively strikes, reason often takes a backseat to desires. Logic gives way to spontaneous choices fueled by emotions. This is when impulse buying takes over, even pushing aside practical things like budgets, for the sake of instant satisfaction.\n\n\nYet, for ethical e-commerce businesses, a bigger role awaits \u2013 guiding responsible impulse buying. It\u2019s not just about making money; it\u2019s about building a trustworthy connection. In a world full of options, embracing ethics in your strategy is both noble and smart, creating an atmosphere where customers feel respected and empowered.\n\n\nPersonalized Harmonies\n----------------------\n\n\nEncouraging impulse buying is like creating a music show. Imagine suggesting products that really match what customers like making their purchases more valuable. Personalized suggestions, picked just for them, create a tune that shoppers really enjoy. It\u2019s like a special song for each person.\n\n\nThe Tapestry of Trust\n---------------------\n\n\nAs customers leave your online shop, the good feelings shouldn\u2019t disappear. They should stick around in their hearts and thoughts. The process doesn\u2019t stop at checkout; it goes on to build trust. With every buy, try to create a link that goes beyond just buying and selling. Aim for real satisfaction that turns quick decisions into strong memories.\n\n\nIn this process, the good feelings you create\u2014trust, liking what you offer, and being happy\u2014grow into the loyalty that people have for your brand. These feelings, taken care of, make a strong connection between your business and its customers.\n\n\nNavigating the Return Currents\n------------------------------\n\n\nIn the world of impulse buying, returns shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. When feelings guide a purchase, there might be regrets later. As someone who cares about good shopping, try to make returns happen less often. You can do this by giving the right rewards, ones that customers still like after the excitement has passed.\n\n\nWhen you stop a return, you save money in the background. Costs like shipping and resources become smaller, like a group of singers that echoes your promise to make customers happy.\n\n\nAs you stand where impulse buying and ethical business meet, remember: everything you suggest, every time you connect with a customer shapes what people think about your brand. In the dance between doing things fast and doing things right, the choices you make today affect what happens in the future. Welcome to the world of ethical impulse buying\u2014a journey that enjoys desires while building trust and loyalty.\n\n\nImpulsive Buying \u2013 Do\u2019s & Don\u2019ts\n================================\n\n\nDo Offer Recommendations. Don\u2019t Recommend Irrelevant Products!\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nExercise caution when suggesting products to customers in the pursuit of cross-selling and upselling opportunities. While the goal might include streamlining your inventory, that shouldn\u2019t be the sole basis for these recommendations. Instead, think of it as a chance to enhance their shopping experience. Should you opt to propose bundles or markdowns, ensure that the suggested items align seamlessly with their intended purchase, creating a synergy that adds to its value.\n\n\nSteer clear of presenting outdated or obsolete products that have long been dormant in your inventory. The focus should remain on enhancing their shopping experience and addressing their needs, rather than merely pushing products out the door. This approach not only fosters a more satisfying buying journey but also contributes to sustaining a loyal customer base, further nurturing the dynamic landscape of impulse buying.\n\n\n\nDo Share Reminder Notifications. Don\u2019t Push for Subscriptions!\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCustomers will always buy a few products regularly, for example, skincare products, hair care products, pet foods, etc. As a proactive measure, consider reminding your customers ahead of time about the upcoming month\u2019s necessities. Keeping them informed not only ensures they\u2019re well-prepared but also can prompt reorders when certain items are temporarily unavailable.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, there\u2019s an art to it. Avoid the temptation to nudge customers into subscription boxes, as their preferences should be respected. Instead, when sending out these reminders, carve out a dedicated space to illustrate the value that a subscription box can offer. This approach empowers customers to independently opt in, aligning their choices with their convenience and preferences.\n\n\nBy implementing thoughtful reminder notifications, you\u2019re not just facilitating smoother shopping experiences; you\u2019re building a rapport based on customer-centricity. This, in turn, adds a harmonious note to the symphony of impulse buying dynamics.\n\n\nDo Offer Free Shipping. Don\u2019t Offer It At Your Own Expense!\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLeveraging free shipping can significantly amplify impulse buying. Don\u2019t miss out on an effective strategy: prominently showcase reminders regarding the minimum spending threshold required to unlock the allure of free shipping. As customers curate their carts, consider suggesting complementary items that align with their selections, helping them attain the threshold.\n\n\nHowever, remember the art of balance. While striving to offer this enticing perk, be cautious about eroding your margins. Craft a well-thought-out free shipping plan that aligns with your business goals. Consider integrating free shipping with strategic offerings such as bundles, kits, or BOGO deals. Furthermore, implementing a minimum order value of Rs. 1000 as the eligibility criterion for free shipping can also provide a clear incentive for customers to explore more of your offerings.\n\n\n\nDo Leverage Different Channels to Market. Don\u2019t Overwhelm them!\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHarness the immense potential of various marketing channels to ignite the spark of impulse buying within your customers. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and more hold the key to cultivating a culture of spontaneous shopping. Consider leveraging the power of WhatsApp messages and SMSes to swiftly relay the latest and most irresistible offers directly to your customers\u2019 fingertips.\n\n\nHowever, like any grand symphony, a harmonious execution is key. When orchestrating an omnichannel strategy, ensure that every note resonates seamlessly. Crafting a consistent and cohesive experience across all touchpoints is essential to captivate customers effectively. This synergy across channels doesn\u2019t just facilitate impulse buying; it orchestrates a comprehensive and captivating journey that leaves a resonant impact.\n\n\n\n> 65% of impulsive shoppers regret their purchases.\n> \n> \n\n\nAs you strive to enhance sales and elevate your business\u2019s revenue, remember that your ultimate objective is to guide your customers towards informed purchase decisions. In this journey, the spotlight shifts to the intrinsic value of your offerings\u2014be it discounts, special offers, or curated bundles. The key lies in weaving a narrative that doesn\u2019t merely convey the deal\u2019s worth but also resonates deeply with your customers.\n\n\nAllow your products to tell a story, a tale that intertwines seamlessly with their aspirations and needs. Illuminate the significance of what you\u2019re presenting, showing them the puzzle piece they\u2019ve been missing. Invite them to envision a world where these offerings enhance their lives, filling gaps they might not have been aware of.\n\n\nDo Offer a Seamless Checkout. Don\u2019t Ask Customers to Fill Long & Boring Checkout Forms!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA streamlined checkout is the secret ingredient that keeps impulse purchases flowing smoothly and guards against potential sales slipping away. The ticking of every additional second that a customer spends navigating lengthy and tiresome checkout forms can be the turning point that leads to a change of heart and, ultimately, cart abandonment.\n\n\n\n> Did you know? A significant 18% of customers opt out when they find the checkout process overly complicated. It\u2019s a vivid reminder of the thin line between sealing the deal and losing a potential sale.\n> \n> \n\n\nImagine the spark of excitement customers experience as they discover products, tossing them into their carts with a sense of instant gratification. This rush of impulse should seamlessly translate into the moment they decide to make a purchase. Any disruption, however minor, can swiftly extinguish this spark, leading to abandoned carts in the blink of an eye.\n\n\nThat\u2019s where the magic of solutions like Razorpay Magic Checkout enters the stage.

Don\u2019t Restrict Payment Methods\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe COD payment method simplifies the purchasing process for customers. It\u2019s a catalyst for impulse shopping, removing the need for upfront payment and bypassing the hassle of entering payment information, which can be an added hurdle. This translates to quicker checkouts and a boost in spontaneous purchases.\n\n\nEmbracing COD as a payment choice can expand an online business\u2019s customer base, yet it might not fit everyone\u2019s needs.

Magic Checkout meticulously examines each order, raising a flag for orders that exhibit a higher likelihood of Return to Origin (RTO) patterns.

Don\u2019t Hide Coupon Codes\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCoupon codes wield a fascinating power \u2013 they can ignite the flames of FOMO, or the irresistible fear of missing out, within potential customers. When online stores unveil limited-time or exclusive coupon codes, an electrifying urgency takes center stage. Shoppers sense the ticking clock, a countdown to a golden opportunity that compels them to act swiftly, leading to impulsive shopping extravaganzas.\n\n\nLet\u2019s explore the artistry of coupon codes in crafting FOMO:\n\n\nImagine a 24-hour flash sale, a realm of discounted delights accessible through a secret code. This ephemeral oasis urges customers to seize the moment, to let their impulses guide them toward irresistible bargains. The urgency dances through the air, a symphony of fleeting opportunities that demands immediate action.\n\n\nNow, consider the allure of exclusivity. Coupon codes whispered only to an inner circle of email subscribers or social media enthusiasts. These chosen few bask in the glory of their secret code, a key to treasures not accessible to the masses. The air crackles with a sense of being part of something special, a privileged realm of savings reserved for the select.\n\n\nCoupon codes, the conjurers of FOMO, master the art of persuasion through time-bound discounts and secret societies of savings. With a dash of urgency and a pinch of exclusivity, they invite customers into a world where impulses reign and the thrill of the deal takes center stage.\n\n\nWrapping Up\n===========\n\n\nImpulse buying can be a game-changer for any online business. To make the most of it, offer products that truly matter to your customers. Put them first and think about what they need, even if it\u2019s not immediate. By doing this, you can build trust, keep them engaged, and create loyalty that lasts. So, let ethics guide your strategy and put your customers at the heart of it all. This way, you\u2019ll turn fleeting urges into lasting connections, driving your eCommerce venture to new heights.", "[July 23, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/credit-line-vs-credit-card/)\n\n8 Mins Read\n\n\nChoosing between credit line vs credit card can be a confusing decision for businesses.

It functions as a flexible financing option where the borrower can withdraw funds up to the approved credit limit and only pay interest on the amount borrowed.\n\n\n### Benefits of credit line:\n\n\n1. **Flexibility:** The primary benefit of [credit line](https://razorpay.com/learn/how-to-use-a-credit-line-for-your-business/) lies in its flexibility. Unlike conventional loans that have set repayment schedules, a credit line provides the freedom to borrow funds up to a pre-approved credit limit.  \n\nYou are only required to repay the specific amount borrowed in easy EMIs, rather than the entire credit limit.Moreover, the tenure is also flexible, with options spanning 3, 6, or 12 months.

Although both of them are forms of credit, their specific features make them useful in different situations.\n\n\nFor instance, credit cards may be more suitable for regular expenses due to the rewards and purchase protections they offer, as well as the extended payment period they provide. On the other hand, a credit line might be a better choice for significant expenses or ongoing projects because it allows for borrowing larger amounts and potentially paying lower interest over time.\n\n\nThe decision ultimately depends on the loan terms and how you intend to utilise and repay the borrowed funds. Regardless of the financing option you consider, it is crucial to compare interest rates, fees, borrower benefits, and repayment terms offered by different providers.\n\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n\n### Q1: What is the main difference between credit line vs credit card?\n\n\nA credit line is a predetermined amount of fund that a business can borrow from a lender. It provides flexibility in terms of borrowing and repayment. A credit card, on the other hand, is a revolving line of credit that allows businesses to make purchases up to a certain credit limit.\n\n\n### Q2: When should I consider using a credit line for my business?\n\n\nA credit line is typically useful for businesses that need access to larger amounts of capital for specific purposes such as funding expansion, covering inventory costs, or managing cash flow during seasonal fluctuations. It can provide a lump sum of funds that you can draw from as needed, and you only pay interest on the amount borrowed.\n\n\n### Q3: When should I consider using a credit card for my business?\n\n\nA credit card is beneficial for day-to-day expenses, smaller purchases, and recurring payments. It offers convenience, rewards, and often includes features like purchase protections and extended payment periods. It can be suitable for managing regular online business expenses and improving cash flow management.\n\n\n### Q4: How can I access cash with credit line vs credit card?\n\n\nBoth options allow cash withdrawals, but the process and associated fees can vary. With credit line, the amount is deposited directly into your bank account. Credit cards often allow cash advances, but they may come with higher interest rates and additional fees.\n\n\n### Q5: How does credit line vs credit card impact my business\u2019s credit rating?\n\n\nBoth credit line and credit cards can impact your business\u2019s credit rating positively if managed responsibly. Making timely payments and maintaining a low credit utilisation ratio can help build a strong credit history, which is beneficial for future financing opportunities.\n\n\n### Q6: Can I have both credit line and credit card for my business?\n\n\nYes, it is common for businesses to have both. Each serves a different purpose and can provide the flexibility needed for various financial situations. However, it\u2019s important to use them responsibly and manage the repayment obligations effectively to avoid accumulating excessive debt.\n\n\nRemember, it is always recommended to consult with a financial advisor or banking professional who can assess your specific business needs and guide you in choosing the most suitable option for your circumstances.", "[July 20, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/how-to-use-a-credit-line-for-your-business/)\n\n8 Mins Read\n\n\n***A credit line offers greater borrowing flexibility when compared to a traditional loan.***\n\n\nAs an ambitious business owner, you know that success often hinges on the ability to seize growth opportunities when they arise.

Unlike conventional loans, where a lump sum amount is provided upfront, a Credit Line allows you to borrow funds up to a predetermined limit, as and when you need them. This revolving structure means you only pay interest on the amount you utilise, giving you greater control over your finances.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvantages of a credit line\n---------------------------\n\n\nIn today\u2019s digital era, the availability of an online line of credit has transformed the borrowing landscape, offering numerous advantages tailored to new-age businesses:\n\n\n**Ease**\n\n\n* Applying for a credit line in India has never been easier.

On average, the recruitment process in India may take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months. The process includes stages like sourcing candidates, screening resumes, conducting interviews, and finalising job offers. Some roles may require longer recruitment periods to find the right fit, while urgent positions might have a faster turnaround time.\n\n\n\n\n\n### How important is cultural fit during the recruitment process?\n\n\n\nCultural fit is a critical aspect of the recruitment process in India.

To achieve this, organisations can implement blind recruitment practices to mitigate unconscious biases. Encouraging employee referrals from diverse networks can also attract a broader talent pool. Additionally, promoting equal opportunity policies and offering fair and transparent compensation packages support an inclusive work environment that attracts talent from diverse backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n### What are the key steps in the recruitment process?\n\n\n\nThe recruitment process typically involves several key steps, including job analysis and planning, sourcing candidates through job portals and networking, screening resumes, conducting interviews, assessing candidates' skills, checking references, and making job offers. Each step plays a crucial role in identifying and hiring the right candidates for the organisation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### How can I improve my recruitment process to attract top talent?\n\n\n\nTo attract top talent, consider optimizing your job descriptions to be clear, engaging, and culturally relevant.

Here\u2019s an example.\n\n\nPicture this: you\u2019re the founder of a small business, and your clients owe you money. They\u2019ve promised they\u2019ll pay you back in six months \u2013 they\u2019ve even signed an invoice guaranteeing it.\n\n\nBut you need money\u00a0*now.*You need to pay rent, your employees\u2019 salaries, buy office supplies\u2026 do you take a loan? Do you borrow money from friends?\n\n\nThis is where factoring comes in.\n\n\nFactoring Meaning in Finance\n----------------------------\n\n\nBy selling accounts receivable, or unpaid invoices to a third party at a discounted rate, businesses can unlock funding to cover cash flow shortfalls in the short term.\n\n\nFactoring is an important source of capital for businesses \u2013 especially startups, or businesses that operate in industries with long receivable cycles, since it involves no collateral, no risk and ensures short-term liquidity.\n\n\nLet\u2019s break that down.\n\n\n\u00a0How Does Factoring Work?\n-------------------------\n\n\nFactoring involves three parties:\n\n\n* Business/Client Firm\n* Factor\n* Debtor\n\n\nThe debtor owes money to the business/client firm, which is documented in an invoice. The debtor is expected to repay the business within a certain period of time.\n\n\nIf the business has short term cash requirements, it can\u00a0sell this invoice to a factor at a discounted rate.\n\n\nThe factor purchases the invoice from the business in exchange for cash, which the business can use immediately, instead of waiting six months for the original invoice to mature.\n\n\nWhen the invoice matures in six months, the vendor/debtor will repay the original amount to the factor and not to the business.\n\n\nBenefits of Factoring as a Source of Funding\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Fulfils Financial Needs** | Young businesses have high overheads and daily operational costs. Factoring unlocks liquid cash in the short-term with minimal risk.\u00a0 |\n| **Reduces Risk** | With factoring, businesses can insulate themselves from the risk of defaults and bad debts. These risks are taken on by the factor! |\n| **No Collateral Funding** | Factoring is one of the few funding options where businesses do not need to provide collateral, making it completely risk-free! |\n| **No Credit Checks** | Unlike bank loans, availing funding through factoring does not require high creditworthiness or extensive background checks.\u00a0 |\n| **Improves Cash Flow** | Factoring is a great source of cash inflow especially for industries where receivables take a long time to convert to cash. |\n\n\n**Drawbacks of Factoring as a Finance Option**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\nFactoring as a source of finance does also have its drawbacks \u2013 it reduces the business\u2019s profit margin, since the business has to sell one of its assets at lower than cost.\n\n\nFurther, making debtors deal with a third party (the factor) may hinder the business\u2019s relationship with them.\n\n\nAnd lastly, \u2013 for a business to avail factoring as a source of finance, it has to have accounts receivable to sell in the first place! For businesses with no accounts receivable, factoring is completely out of reach.\n\n\nDespite these drawbacks, factoring remains one of the most reliable and commonly used sources of short-term finance for businesses, especially startups.\n\n\nTypes of Factoring\n------------------\n\n\n**![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/07/0_SDIq4A3NcHfDmj7d.webp)**\n\n\nOn the basis of default risk:\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Recourse Factoring** | **Non-Recourse Factoring** |\n| In this type of factoring, the factor does not take on the risk of default. If the debtor fails to repay the invoice, the liability falls on the business firm itself.\u00a0 | The liability of bad debt remains with the factor, and they cannot reclaim the money from the business in case the debtor defaults.\u00a0\u00a0 |\n\n\n\nOn the basis of disclosure:\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Disclosed Factoring** | **Undisclosed Factoring** |\n| When the factor\u2019s name is mentioned in the invoice by the debtor, and the debtor is fully aware that the invoice is being prefinanced by the factor.\u00a0 | The name of the factor is not mentioned, and the debt is repaid to the business \u2013 but the invoice and control is with the factor.\u00a0 |\n\n\n\nOn the basis of trade:\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Domestic Factoring** | **Export Factoring** |\n| When all three parties (factor, firm and debtor) reside and operate in the same country. | Where one or more parties operate or reside overseas. In export factoring, there are four parties involved: exporter/seller, importer/buyer, export factor and import factor.\u00a0 |\n\n\n\nOn the basis of payment:\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Advance Factoring** | **Maturity Factoring** |\n| The factor gives the business an advance payment in exchange for the accounts receivable. | The factor makes the payment only on the date of maturity of the invoice. Businesses opt for this method to insulate themselves from credit risk.\u00a0 |\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n#### Why Financial Management is So Important\n\n\nFactoring helps business improve inflow of cash and reduces credit risk \u2013 two important parts of an overall financial management strategy.\n\n\nHaving a solid financial management strategy is key \u2013 especially for young businesses and startups. Here\u2019s a few other strategies that make a high-growth financial management strategy.\n\n\n* A solid investment strategy and a well-diversified [portfolio](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/portfolio/)\n* Well-thought out budget and forecast plan for each quarter\n* Top talent to facilitate and support growth \u2013 and employee retention plans to keep them\n* [Automated financial management](https://razorpay.com/x?r=blog_cta_business_banking_factoring&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=cta) for minimal errors and smooth finances\n\n\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n### What are the types of factoring?\n\n\n\nPrimarily, there are four types of factoring, recourse factoring and non-recourse factoring, domestic and export factoring, disclosed and undisclosed factoring, lastly advance and maturity factoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n### How does factoring work in finance?\n\n\n\nIn factoring, a factor finances a company against its accounts receivables at a lower price. However, the factor charges a commission for the services it provides. Mostly small and medium size organisations acquire funding for their working capital needs by transferring the ownership of accounts receivable to the factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is the difference between recourse and non-recourse factoring?\n\n\n\nRecourse factoring is a type of factoring in which, any unpaid uncollectable or disputed invoice is recourse or sold back to the client. In non-recourse factoring, the liability of an account receivable is transferred to a factoring company. Factoring companies charge a much higher factoring fee with non-recourse factoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is the typical factoring advance rate?\n\n\n\nThe rates of advances provided by factor companies vary on the industry and volume. The advance rate charged by factors can be anywhere between 80% \u2013 95%.\n\n\n\n\n\n### How does invoice factoring benefit a business?\n\n\n\nFactoring against accounts receivables can help companies with regular cash infusions that will significantly improve cash flow and operational working capital. With the help of factoring services, businesses do not have to manage receivables and collections of payments.", "[July 13, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/guide-to-audience-research-tech-writing/)\n\n5 Mins Read\n\n\nWriting content without understanding your audience or conducting audience research is like shooting in the dark. You hope your arrow will reach its mark, but how can it, if not aimed properly? By creating a one size fits all content, you will be pushing out generic content not tailored to your audience\u2019s needs.\n\n\nWhether you are writing a thriller novel or a blog, or straight-up technical documentation, it is vital to research the intended audience. This helps to create content that truly connects with your readers.\n\n\nTypes of Audiences\n==================\n\n\nBroadly, there are three types of audiences that you must consider while writing any piece of technical content:\n\n\n**![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-12.52.35-PM.png)Professionals/Technical Experts**\n\n\nThis audience segment is technically sound and has advanced topic knowledge. They are used to industry jargon and words. This cohort forms the main user base if you are writing API/SDK documentation.\n\n\n**Business Executives/ Decision Makers**\n\n\nThis segment consists of leaders and executives who navigate through the documentation and make the buy or no-buy decision based on the perceived business value/ease of use. They may or may not have extensive technical knowledge.\n\n\n**Non-technical Users**\n\n\nThis segment comprises employees or other individuals such as students. They don\u2019t have in-depth technical acumen and are mostly looking for procedural documentation which explains how to use a particular product.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWhy is Audience Research Important\n==================================\n\n\nAs we saw above, various audiences come from all walks of life. While some can understand complex information, others seek simple instructions to complete a task and achieve their goal.\u00a0\n\n\nLet us take the example of [API Integration Documents](https://razorpay.com/docs/api/). The main users of these documents are developers. Now these developers may have different experience levels \u2013 some may be fresh college graduates, while others could be industry veterans. It is then the writer\u2019s responsibility to craft documentation that suits all cohorts\u2019 needs.\u00a0\n\n\nNot convinced? Here are some more reasons:\n\n\n* **International audiences**\n\n\nIt is vital to understand the geographic distribution of the audience. In today\u2019s age, where product adoption is across continents, technical communicators must ensure that the content meets the global standards regarding how data is presented \u2013 the numeral system, date format, and currency.\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, if you have written for an Indian audience earlier and now need to extend it to an international audience, you might need to adopt the international numeral system, change the currency used and so on. While this might appear to be a small thing, it can have major implications.\n\n\n* **Readability index**\n\n\nWhen we document complex systems, we might use words or construct long sentences that some audience segments cannot easily understand. By running the content through tools that evaluate content readability, we can create simpler content that a larger section of the audience can easily consume. Tools such as Grammarly come with in-built features that determine content readability scores.  \n\n\n\n\n![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-12.51.57-PM.png)\n\n\n* ******Delivering the right content******\n\n\nWhen we understand more about the audience, we can rethink how content is presented to them.

Investors can compare the ratios of different companies to make informed investment decisions.\n\n\n* **Creditworthiness Assessment**\n\n\nCreditors, such as banks or suppliers, utilise ratio analysis to evaluate the creditworthiness and repayment capacity of a company.

This ratio analysis can be performed by choosing a single financial ratio and evaluating that to a fixed cadence.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Ratio Analysis Across Companies**\n\n\nThis financial ratios analysis tactic involves considering the financial performance of the company with its competitors of similar business niches. During this comparison, different metrics are accessed like similar niche-different product lines, capital structures, changes made in technology incorporation, etc.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Ratio Analysis Against Benchmarks**\n\n\nDue to the ease of financial ratios analysis and its calculations, every company sets internal targets for financial ratios. However, benchmarks are set by external parties like lending institutions to assess the company\u2019s future performance.\u00a0\n\n\nLending firms set a special requirement to understand the financial health of companies which is directly related to loan documents. Companies that will not be able to meet those requirements will be imposed higher interest payments as a penalty.\u00a0\n\n\n**RazorpayX Can Help Entrepreneurs in Taking the Right Financial Decisions**\n\n\nEntrepreneurs have a myriad of responsibilities on their plate; hence they need a robust banking solution that will ease their financial decision-making process.

It also helps in understanding the company's strengths, efficiency and weaknesses while projecting the upcoming earnings and cash flow of a firm. \n\n\n\n\n\n### Why is conducting ratio analysis important?\n\n\n\nFinancial ratio analysis allows for the comparison of a company's financial performance to industry peers, competitors, or sector benchmarks. It helps stakeholders understand how a company is positioned relative to others in the industry, identify competitive advantages or disadvantages, and benchmark performance against industry standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n### What are the examples of ratio analysis?\n\n\n\nCurrent ratio, inventory turnover ratio, and gross profit margin ratio are few examples of ratio analysis. These financial ratios help understand the company's future performance and hence people largely use this method to assess the net profit margin. This metric or ratio is important for investors to decipher the profitability of the company concerning its competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is the difference between the current ratio and the quick ratio?\n\n\n\nThe current ratio and quick ratio both come under the liquidity ratio. However, one of the primary differences between the current ratio and the quick ratio is that the current ratio considers all the current assets of the company during calculation. Whereas, quick ratio only gets hold of the firm's liquid assets for evaluation.", "[July 11, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/accounting-cycle/)\n\n6 Mins Read\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n* [What is an Accounting Cycle?](#What-is-an-Accounting-Cycle \"What is an Accounting Cycle?\")\n* [Understanding the 8 Steps of an Accounting Cycle](#Understanding-the-8-Steps-of-an-Accounting-Cycle \"Understanding the 8 Steps of an Accounting Cycle\")\n* [What is the Importance of the Accounting Cycle?](#What-is-the-Importance-of-the-Accounting-Cycle \"What is the Importance of the Accounting Cycle?\")\n* [Difference Between Accounting Cycle & Budget Cycle](#Difference-Between-Accounting-Cycle-Budget-Cycle \"Difference Between Accounting Cycle & Budget Cycle\u00a0\")\n\n**What is an Accounting Cycle?**\n--------------------------------\n\n\nAn accounting cycle is a sequence of steps by which a company completes its bookkeeping tasks. It follows an 8-step process and considers one complete reporting period involving recording and analysis of different financial transactions of a business.\u00a0\n\n\nThe primary objective of conducting this process is to anticipate and understand upcoming financial needs and take decisions accordingly. Companies, based on their need, analyse their financial standpoints regularly \u2013 monthly, quarterly or yearly basis.\u00a0\n\n\n**Understanding the 8 Steps of an Accounting Cycle**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Step 1: Identifying and Analysing Transactions**\n\n\nThe first step is to identify and analyse financial transactions that have occurred during a specific accounting period. This involves reviewing several invoices, bank statements and receipts.\u00a0\n\n\n**Step 2: Journalising**\n\n\nOnce the transactions have been identified and analysed, record them in the general journal. A journal in accounting highlights records of all financial activities of a business and is transferred to other records like a general ledger. Each transaction entered in a journal states its date, accounts involved, and respective debit and credit amounts.\n\n\n**Step 3: Ledger Posting**\n\n\nAfter journalising, transfer the entries to the general ledger. Ledgers are the secondary books of accounts and record date-wise transactions for one particular account. This involves posting each entry to appropriate accounts in the ledger, such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and so on.\n\n\n**Step 4: Adjusting Entries**\n\n\nAt the end of the accounting period, adjust entries to ensure proper recognition of revenues and expenses. These entries account for items such as accrued expenses, prepaid expenses, unearned revenues, and accrued revenues.\n\n\n**Step 5: Adjusted Trial Balance**\n\n\nOnce adjusting entries have been recorded and posted , prepare an adjusted trial balance. A trial balance highlights all closing balances of accounts recorded in different ledgers. An adjusted trial balance lists all accounts with their updated balances after incorporating the adjusting entries.\n\n\n**Step 6: Financial Statements**\n\n\nUsing the adjusted trial balance, prepare financial statements such as the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. These statements provide a detailed analysis of a company\u2019s financial performance and position during the accounting period.\n\n\n**Step 7: Closing Entries**\n\n\nAt the end of the accounting period, close all temporary accounts, such as revenues, expenses, and dividends, by transferring their balances to permanent accounts. This process brings back the temporary accounts to zero balance in preparation for the next accounting year.\n\n\n**Step 8: Post-Closing Trial Balance**\n\n\nNow after closing financial entries, prepare a post-closing trial balance to ensure that the books are in balance. This trial balance includes only permanent accounts.\n\n\n**What is the Importance of the Accounting Cycle?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\n* **Recording Transactions**\n\n\nThe accounting cycle ensures the systematic recording of all financial transactions that occur within a specific accounting period. This includes documenting the inflows and outflows of money, as well as other economic events that impact a company\u2019s financial position.\n\n\n* **Organising Financial Data**\n\n\nThis process helps organise financial data in a structured manner. Through processes like journalising and posting to the general ledger, transactions are categorised into specific accounts (e.g., cash, accounts payable, accounts receivable) based on their nature. This organisation facilitates the preparation of accurate financial statements and supports analysis and decision-making.\n\n\n* **Providing Accurate Financial Statements**\n\n\nBy following the accounting cycle, businesses can generate financial statements such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. These statements summarise the financial performance, position, and cash flows of the company, enabling stakeholders to assess its financial health and make informed decisions.\n\n\n* **Enabling Financial Analysis**\n\n\nThe accounting cycle ensures accurate recording and organising of financial data, allowing for meaningful financial analysis. By analysing these financial statements and using tools such as ratios and trends, stakeholders can evaluate a company\u2019s profitability, liquidity, solvency, and efficiency. This analysis assists in assessing the company\u2019s performance, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and making informed financial decisions.\n\n\n* **Facilitating Regulatory Compliance and External Reporting**\n\n\nThe accounting cycle ensures that financial records and reports comply with accounting principles, standards, and regulatory requirements. It provides the necessary documentation and evidence for audits, tax filings, and external reporting to stakeholders such as shareholders, investors, lenders, and regulatory authorities.\n\n\n**Difference Between Accounting Cycle & Budget Cycle**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Basis of Difference** | **Accounting Cycle** | **Budget Cycle** |\n| **Definition** | The accounting cycle is a systematic process that businesses follow to record, analyse, and report their financial transactions.

It excludes cash flows from investing activities.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Free Cash Flow to Equity**\n\n\nThe free cash flow to equity is the cash reserve that is left after the reinvestment of the capital.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Free Cash Flow to the Company**\n\n\nThe free cash flow to a company is the amount of cash derived from operations and is calculated after the payment of depreciation, expenses, and taxes. This is primarily used for financial valuation and determines a company\u2019s profitability.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Net Change in Cash**\n\n\nThis shows the overall change in cash flow from one accounting year to another.\u00a0\n\n\n**What are the Functions of Cash Management?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\n* **Inventory Management**\n\n\nInventory management ensures to clear the blockage of any trapped sales which leads to the higher stock-in-hand. As increased stocks in inventory indicate decreased levels of liquidity, by effective fund management, companies can aim to clear out existing stocks which will ensure inflows of cash.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Receivables Management**\n\n\nGenerally, after a credit sale, a company records an entry of sale; however, the payment of the same is often in the pending status. Cash management plays the function of effectively paying all the bills receivables to remove any shortage of liquid cash.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Payables Management**\n\n\nPayables are the company\u2019s liability when purchasing any items on credit. Sometimes organisations obtain loads from lending institutions or banks and are liable to repay within a stipulated time. Hence, effective fund management ensures that the repayment is made on time, avoiding any penalties or compensatory interest.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Short-Term Investment**\n\n\nThe primary essence of cash management revolves around factors like avoidance of cash crunch and insolvency. Moreover, this can also be used to invest in shorter-term instruments like government securities to increase the value of money.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**What are the Objectives of Cash Management?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n* **Cash Flow Management**\n\n\nThe primary objective of cash management is controlling cash inflows and outflows. Most importantly, this approach ensures a lower fund outflow and enhances inflow, promoting an optimistic financial position of a company. Cash management identifies all the sources of cash outflows and adopts measures to restrict them; thereby reducing operational expenses.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Effective Planning of Future Funds**\n\n\nIt optimises cash in a way that makes future cash reserves meet short-term obligations. This also assists in planning better capital expenditure and assessing financial ratios of debt and equity. In other words, with effective planning the company will also have sufficient reserves of liquid cash for catering to any unforeseen expenses.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Meet the Requirement of Unexpected Expenses**\n\n\nOne of the primary objectives of keeping enough liquid cash through effective cash management is catering to unexpected expenses. This may include the breakdown of machinery or any other uncalled occurrence for which the company should not fall out of surplus cash.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Avoid Insolvency**\n\n\nIneffective cash management may result in a shortage of funds which may result in failure in bill payment. This, in turn, may lead to insolvency and demolish the goodwill of that organisation.\u00a0\n\n\n**7 Ways to Improve Cash Management**\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n* Lower the credit period by managing receivables through optimization of the billing and collection process.\n\n\n* Enhance the cash inflows by entering into lucrative negotiations with the suppliers.\n\n\n* Curtail traditional payment processes and incorporate different online payment systems.\n\n\n* Carry periodic reviews and update cash management processes and policies to ensure their effectiveness.\n\n\n* Schedule regular auditing of cash management to allocate areas of improvement and adhere to all the necessary compliances.\n\n\n* Reduce cash outflows by locating unnecessary expenses and monitoring them.\n\n\n* Incorporate better cash management tactics to make the cash balances and transactions visible.\n\n\n**What are the Basic Principles of Cash Management?**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n* **Expedite Process of Cash Receivables**\n\n\nOne of the basic principles of cash management is to monitor and accelerate the cash receivables margin.

Effective cash management aims at lowering this inventory and initiating sales by incorporating different sales.\u00a0\n\n\n**Top 5 Cash Management Strategies**\n------------------------------------\n\n\n* **Budgeting and Forecasting**\n\n\nBudgeting and forecasting is a cash management strategy where a company forecasts the different sources of cash inflows. Based on this forecasting the accounts department creates a budget which is used to manage operations and meet any potential shortfalls.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Negotiating Favourable Terms of Payment**\n\n\nDuring entering into a contract, the business needs to negotiate terms of payment for better management of cash flows into the company. Moreover, establishing proper strategies like if customers make an early payment, they will get some percentage of discounts.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Establishing Better Collection and Billing Methods**\n\n\nIncorporating the best collection and billing method in a company is an optimistic way of cash management. Simpler and hassle-free processes like online payment gateways will be incorporated, which will lead to ease in paying the credit.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Lowering Expenses**\n\n\nBeing one of the most essential cash management strategies, companies need to identify unnecessary expenses and reduce them to conserve cash.

By providing funding for self-employment and entrepreneurship, microfinance institutions (MFIs) help people create a steady source of income and become financially independent.\n\n\nWhile microfinance institutions provide the means for people to set up businesses, banks like ICICI and fintech solutions like RazorpayX provide banking solutions to help businesses manage their finances with ease.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**How Does Microfinance Work?**\n-------------------------------\n\n\nMicrofinance loans are given to people, businesses or groups that are impoverished and are not able to apply for regular loans due to a lack of income.\u00a0\n\n\nThese groups are excluded from mainstream, traditional banking services since they might not be considered creditworthy or financially sound.\u00a0\n\n\nMicrofinance loans are of significantly smaller amounts and therefore impose lesser interest rates and more flexible repayment schedules. For example, most of the loans offered by [ESAF Microfinance](https://www.esafbank.com/account/micro-banking/) range between Rs 2,000 to Rs 30,000.\u00a0\n\n\nToday, most banks and NBFCs that give out loans conduct assessments and analyses to determine if the person receiving the loan is creditworthy enough. CIBIL scores and other tests help determine the risk of giving out the loan.\u00a0\n\n\nAn important factor in these tests is income. Impoverished entities do not have enough income to be considered creditworthy enough to qualify for a traditional loan.\n\n\nFinancial institutions that provide microfinance loans do so with the intention of helping these groups become financially independent and self-sufficient. They provide financial assistance with no intention of earning interest income \u2013 and also provide training programs, resources and support to help these entrepreneurs succeed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**General Terms of Microfinance Loans**\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nAll microfinance loans come with certain requirements and terms. As long as an individual fulfils these terms, they are eligible for the loan.\u00a0\n\n\nHaving low or no income is one of the basic requirements to be eligible for a microfinance loan. Individuals from marginalized groups are eligible for these loans as well.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are also specialized loan offerings, like agricultural microfinance loans and home improvement loans which have other specific requirements.\u00a0\n\n\nSince the recipients of these loans are too poor to offer traditional collateral as required by banks, microlenders often group several borrowers together to reduce risk due to default.\u00a0\n\n\nIf a borrower is unable to repay a loan, he may seek help from other borrowers within this group or from the loan officer. The repayment terms for microfinance loans are much more flexible than traditional bank loans.\u00a0\n\n\n**Benefits of Microfinance**\n----------------------------\n\n\nMicrofinance has proven benefits to both social and economic welfare. By empowering impoverished groups of people to earn and become financially independent, microfinance loans have helped unlock a whole section of the population to become productive members of the society.\u00a0\n\n\n**Access to funding:** Microfinance loans, with flexible repayment schedules and lower interest rates, allow immediate and easier access to funds for people who can\u2019t afford or are not eligible for traditional loans.\u00a0\n\n\nThis accessibility allows entire families to get out of a bad situation by funding self-employment or home improvement.\u00a0\n\n\n**Economic benefits:** Microfinance is an important factor in breaking the cycle of poverty. The main reason poor parents beget poor children is due to the fact that they cannot afford quality education, healthcare or other basic facilities.\u00a0\n\n\nMicrofinance provides small, repayable loans to these families \u2013 repayment rates for microfinance loans have always been higher than traditional loans. Poor families can avail these loans, build self-employment opportunities or upskill, and then repay the small amount they had originally borrowed.\u00a0\n\n\n**Building creditworthiness:** Since microfinance loans offer small principals, lower interest rates and flexible repayment schedules, the repayment rates for these loans are very high \u2013 ranging between 90% to 98%.\u00a0\n\n\nBy successfully repaying these small loans, poor families can build their creditworthiness and become eligible for a bigger loan in the future.\u00a0\n\n\n**Microfinance in India**\n-------------------------\n\n\nMicrofinance loans have played a big role in mobilizing the weaker sections of society and improving the living conditions of the poorest.\u00a0\n\n\nMicrofinance loans in India are offered by three major agencies: credit unions, NGOs and banks.\u00a0\n\n\nThese agencies offer microfinance loans and financial assistance by organizing people into various groups:\n\n\n**Joint Liability Group:** A Joint Liability Group (JLG) is an informal gathering comprising 4 to 10 members who come together to secure loans based on mutual guarantee. These loans are primarily intended for agricultural purposes or related activities. The JLG consists of farmers, rural workers, and tenants who share the responsibility for repaying the loan in a timely manner. The structure of the JLG is straightforward and does not require any complex financial administration.\n\n\n**Self Help Group:** A Self Help Group SHG is a group of people with similar socio-economic backgrounds who come together for a limited period to pool resources into a collective fund. This fund is then borrowed by the group members for business requirements.\u00a0\n\n\nMembers of an SHG do not need collateral to borrow from the pool and interest rates are kept very low. Banks partner with these SHGs as part of their commitment to enhance financial inclusion in rural areas.\n\n\n**Grameen Model Bank:** The Grameen Bank operates on the principle of providing small loans, often referred to as microcredit, to the poor and underserved individuals, particularly in rural areas. The amounts offered as loans are small, and are offered to groups of about 5 individuals. These groups act as a guarantor for the members\u2019 loans and thus ensure repayment.\n\n\n**History of Microfinance**\n---------------------------\n\n\nThe evolution of microfinance in India can be traced back to the 1970s and has since experienced significant growth and transformation.\n\n\nThe early years of microfinance in the decades after independence were focused on small-scale credit programs to address financial needs of marginalized groups, especially women.\u00a0\n\n\nFurther introductions of innovative lending methods like Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty in Andhra Pradesh led microfinance to become a significant contributor to the expansion of microfinance.\u00a0\n\n\nBy the 2000s, there were dedicated institutions and banks that offered microfinance loans and credit to the poor, like SKS Microfinance which would become one of the largest MFIs in the country. Regulation of the microfinance sector began to take shape as well, when the RBI stepped in with interest rate caps and other regulatory reforms.\u00a0\n\n\nThese measures by the RBI aimed to strike a balance between protecting borrowers\u2019 interests and ensuring the sustainability of microfinance institutions.\n\n\nIn recent years, microfinance in India has diversified and evolved. Traditional MFIs have expanded their offerings to include savings, insurance, and other financial services. Moreover, the emergence of technology-driven models and the rise of digital platforms have further facilitated access to microfinance and improved operational efficiencies.\n\n\n**Concerns of Microfinance**\n----------------------------\n\n\nWhile microfinance has made significant strides in India, there are also several concerns associated with the sector.\u00a0\n\n\n7. **Indebtedness:** One of the primary concerns is overindebtedness among microfinance borrowers. In some cases, borrowers may take loans from multiple lenders without the ability to repay them all, leading to a cycle of debt. This issue was particularly pronounced during the microfinance crisis in Andhra Pradesh in 2010.\n8. **High Interest Rates:** The interest rates charged by microfinance institutions (MFIs) have been a subject of debate. While MFIs argue that higher rates are necessary to cover the operational costs and risks associated with lending to the poor, critics contend that the rates can sometimes be exorbitant and may exploit vulnerable borrowers.\n9. **Unregulated Informal Sector:** Alongside formal MFIs, there is a large unregulated informal sector involved in microfinance activities. These informal lenders, often referred to as moneylenders or local lenders, may charge significantly high interest rates and engage in coercive collection practices, further exacerbating the issues of overindebtedness and financial exploitation.\n10. **Lack of Transparency:** Some microfinance institutions have faced criticism for their lack of transparency in operations, particularly regarding interest rates, fees, and loan terms. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for borrowers to make informed decisions and can lead to potential exploitation.\n11. **Collection Practices:** Coercive collection practices by certain MFIs have been reported, where aggressive tactics are employed to recover loan repayments. These practices can create undue stress and financial hardship for borrowers, undermining the positive impact of microfinance.\n12. **Lack of Financial Literacy:** Many microfinance borrowers have limited financial literacy, which can hinder their ability to make informed financial decisions, understand loan terms, and manage their finances effectively. It is crucial to provide adequate financial education and support to empower borrowers.\n13. **Vulnerability to External Shocks:** Microfinance borrowers, especially those engaged in agriculture or other weather-dependent activities, are susceptible to external shocks such as natural disasters, price fluctuations, and economic downturns. These shocks can significantly impact their ability to repay loans, making them more vulnerable to financial instability.\n\n\nAddressing these concerns requires a multi-faceted approach involving regulations, responsible lending practices, consumer protection measures, financial literacy programs, and effective grievance redressal mechanisms.\u00a0\n\n\nStriking a balance between providing access to finance and safeguarding the interests of borrowers is crucial for the sustainable development of microfinance in India.\n\n\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n\n\n\n\n### What are the 3 types of microfinance?\n\n\n\nMicrocredit, microinsurance and microsavings are the 3 major types of microfinance. All 3 types work in unison to help provide financial assistance to the poor. \n\n\n\n\n\n### What is an example of microfinance?\n\n\n\nProviding loans in small, easily repayable denominations to people so that they can be uplifted out of poor living conditions is an example of microfinance. \n\n\n\n\n\n### What is the point of microfinance?\n\n\n\nMicrofinance exists to help alleviate poverty by providing financial assistance to under served communities and people.", "[July 7, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/guaranteed-emergency-credit-line/)\n\n5 Mins Read\n\n\nIn the business world, uncertainty is a constant companion.

In this blog post, we\u2019ll explore what GECL is, why it matters, and how it can help your business navigate through uncertain times.\n\n\nUnderstanding Guaranteed Emergency Credit Lines (GECL)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA Guaranteed Emergency Credit Line is a financial product that provides businesses with access to a pre-approved line of credit during emergencies or [uncertain times](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/pre-approved-line-of-credit-usage-benefits/).

Timely access to funds: During emergencies, traditional lending processes can be time-consuming and challenging. GECLs offer expedited access to funds, helping businesses quickly bridge the financial gap and address immediate needs.\n2.

The availability of guaranteed funds reduces the risk of business interruption and increases the chances of survival.\n3. Flexibility and financial stability: GECLs provide businesses with the flexibility to use the funds as needed. Whether it\u2019s covering operational expenses, paying suppliers, or investing in necessary resources for recovery, these credit lines offer financial stability in uncertain times.\n4. Reduced financial strain: When faced with an unexpected crisis, businesses often struggle to obtain credit on favourable terms. GECLs, with their government or institution guarantees, typically come with more favourable terms and lower interest rates compared to other forms of emergency funding.\n5. Strategic planning and risk management: Having a GECL in place allows businesses to [proactively plan](https://razorpay.com/blog/mastering-strategic-thinking-darth-vader/) for emergencies.

Maintain good financial records: Keeping accurate and up-to-date financial records is crucial when applying for a GECL. Lenders will assess your business\u2019s financial health and repayment capacity before approving the credit line.\n\t3. Develop a contingency plan: Create a [contingency plan](https://razorpay.com/blog/navigating-business-uncertainty-feat-han-solo/) that outlines the steps you will take in the event of an emergency. This plan should include how you will utilise the GECL funds to maintain operations and recover from the crisis.\n\t4. Establish relationships with lenders: Build relationships with lenders well before a crisis occurs. This will help you understand their offerings, requirements, and potentially expedite the application process when needed.\n\t5. Regularly review and update your plan: As your business evolves, your emergency preparedness plan should evolve too.

With an emergency credit line, business owners can borrow up to a predetermined amount or credit limit. Interest is charged only on the amount actually borrowed, not on the entire approved limit. In contrast, a business loan refers to a lump sum amount provided by lenders, requiring borrowers to repay both the principal amount and interest over a set repayment tenure.\n\n\n### What are the eligibility criteria for business owners to avail Razorpay Line of Credit?\n\n\nTo qualify for Razorpay Line of Credit, business owners need to meet basic eligibility criteria. This typically includes having a registered business that has been operational for a minimum period of 12 months and maintaining an annual turnover of Rs. 20 lakhs or more.\n\n\n### Can an emergency credit line impact credit score?\n\n\nYes, an emergency credit line can impact credit score. Failure to repay the borrowed amount as per the agreed terms and conditions will result in the borrower being considered a defaulter. This can negatively affect their credit score. Conversely, making timely payments on the credit line will help improve the credit score, demonstrating responsible credit management.\n\n\n### What are the advantages of an emergency credit line over traditional loans?\n\n\nEmergency credit lines offer several advantages over traditional loans, including:\n\n\n* Quick access to funds during emergencies: Credit lines provide immediate access to funds, ensuring timely financial support during unforeseen circumstances.\n* Flexibility in borrowing: Business owners can borrow only the required amount from the approved credit limit, reducing the burden of interest payments on unused funds.\n* Lower interest rates: Emergency credit lines often come with competitive interest rates compared to traditional loans, making them a cost-effective solution.\n* Repayment flexibility: Borrowers can choose to repay the borrowed amount in installments, aligning the repayment schedule with their cash flow and financial capacity.  \n\nConclusion:", "[June 30, 2023](https://razorpay.com/payroll/learn/tin-number-tax-identification-number/)\n\n3 Mins Read\n\n\nTIN number or Tax Identification Number (TIN) is a unique identification number assigned to individuals and businesses for tax purposes in India.

While real assets have a physical form, intangible does not. However, financial assets can have both. In other words, financial assets may or may not have a physical form or existence. The essence of this asset can be determined based on the demand and supply in the marketplace of their trading zone. In addition, most financial assets hold a fair amount of risks.\u00a0\n\n\nThe significant types of financial assets are retirement investment instruments and demand deposit accounts like savings accounts or fixed deposits. It is quintessential to maintain a balance of financial assets in a company as it determines the smooth money flow in the business.\u00a0\n\n\n**Understanding Financial Assets**\n----------------------------------\n\n\nLet\u2019s take an example of a 100 rupee note. It will be constituted as real assets; whereas the total bank balance reflected in the mobile application of the bank will act as intangible assets. On the other hand, the value of this financial asset increases or decreases based on the ownership or claims.\u00a0\n\n\n**What are the Types of Financial Assets?**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n* **Cash or Cash Equivalents**\n\n\nThe cash or cash equivalents present in the balance sheet determine a company\u2019s asset value. These are instruments, present in cash form or are quickly convertible into cash. Some examples are savings accounts, petty cash, money orders, etc.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Bank Deposits**\n\n\nBank deposits are savings, fixed or current deposits which are maintained with financial institutions. It serves as the most common way to preserve your financial assets for safety assurance and interest-earning scope after a while. Moreover, the level of interest rate varies across the bank deposits. For instance, an account holder of a money market account enjoys a comparatively higher rate of interest as compared to savings account holders.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Stocks**\n\n\nStocks means all shares of a company listed in the stock market for investors to buy. When an individual invests in shares it means he or she owns a part of the company\u2019s ownership. Hence, by actively holding a part of a company\u2019s ownership, shareholders are liable in bearing the profit and loss of that company.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Bonds**\n\n\nBonds are popular financial instruments issued by the government or any other firm to raise funds for long-term or short-term projects. This acts as a debt for the lenders as the investment money in the project calls for repayment along with interest. This payment will take place upon the completion of the maturity date of the bonds.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Loans & Receivables**\n\n\nBanks or other financial institutions offer loans which act as financial assets for these entities. It is because by lending a sum of money to the borrower financial institutions can charge interest during the time of repayment.\n\n\n* **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**\n\n\nREITs are companies that contain ownership and management of income-generating real estate properties. It includes office buildings, apartments, or shopping malls. Investors can buy shares of REITs and receive dividends from the rental income generated by the properties.\n\n\n**What are the Classifications of Financial Assets?**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n* **Current Assets**\n\n\nOne of the prominent classifications of financial assets, these are mostly cash and cash equivalents, share and securities, prepaid liabilities, etc. Every company keeps hold of current assets to meet the short-term obligation of the company.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Non-Current Assets**\n\n\nCompanies mainly acquire non-current assets to achieve future goals and reach profitability. Some examples of non-current assets are long-term investments, land and property, trademarks, plant and equipment, etc.\u00a0\n\n\n**Advantages of Financial Assets**\n----------------------------------\n\n\n* **Flexibility**\n\n\nFinancial assets offer flexibility in terms of investment size, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Investors can choose to invest small or large amounts depending on their financial capacity. They can also select short-term or long-term investments based on their investment goals and adapt their strategies according to changing market conditions.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Income Generation**\n\n\nFinancial assets can generate income through dividends, interest payments, or rental income. Dividends are paid by companies to their shareholders, interest payments are received from bonds or fixed-income securities, and rental income can be earned from real estate investments. As a result, investors can maintain a regular cash flow.\n\n\n* **Liquidity**\n\n\nLiquid assets are generally more liquid than physical assets. They can be easily bought and sold in the financial markets, allowing investors to convert them into cash quickly if needed.\n\n\n* **Scope for Capital Appreciation**\n\n\nMany financial assets have the potential to generate capital appreciation over time. For example, stocks and equity-based investments can increase in value as the underlying companies grow and become more profitable. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and properties can also appreciate, providing potential capital gains.\n\n\n**Liquid vs Illiquid Financial Assets**\n---------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Basis of Difference** | **Liquid Financial Assets** | **Illiquid Financial Assets** |\n| **Convertible** | Generally, liquid assets are the type of assets which can be easily converted into cash, not depreciating their market value.\u00a0 | Most illiquid assets cannot be converted to cash easily and are sold only by passing the ownership of the same.\u00a0 |\n| **Examples** | Some of the common examples of liquid financial assets are cash, bank deposits, mutual funds, money market accounts, shares, etc.\u00a0 | Some of the common examples of illiquid financial assets are real estate instruments, land, art pieces, jewellery, machinery and equipment, etc.\u00a0 |\n| **Rate of Appreciation** | The appreciation rate of liquid financial assets is lower than illiquid assets.

However, there are times when businesses may face temporary financial constraints that hinder their day-to-day operations.\n\n\nThis is where working capital loans come to the rescue. In this blog, we will explore the meaning of working capital loans and delve into the requirements and eligibility criteria businesses need to meet to secure this valuable financing option.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding working capital loans\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n[Understanding working capital](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/working-capital/) loans is simple \u2013 they are a type of short-term financing that enables businesses to cover their immediate operational expenses and manage cash flow gaps. These loans are specifically designed to address the working capital needs of businesses, allowing them to fund essential activities such as purchasing inventory, paying suppliers, meeting payroll obligations, and handling other short-term liabilities.\n\n\nA working capital loan is based on the concept of working capital, which represents the difference between a company\u2019s current assets and current liabilities. It serves as a measure of a business\u2019s operational liquidity and financial health. By obtaining a working capital loan, businesses can bridge the gap between their short-term assets, like cash and accounts receivable, and their short-term liabilities, such as accounts payable and short-term debts.\n\n\nTypes of working capital loans\n------------------------------\n\n\nThere are several types of working capital loans available to businesses, each tailored to address specific financial needs and circumstances. Here are some common types of working capital loans:\n\n\n1. Revolving line of credit: This type of working capital loan provides businesses with a pre-approved credit limit from which they can borrow as needed. The borrowed amount can be repaid and borrowed again without the need for reapplying for a loan. Interest is typically charged only on the amount borrowed, making it a flexible financing option for managing fluctuating cash flow needs.\n2. Accounts receivable financing: Also known as invoice financing or factoring, this type of working capital loan allows businesses to borrow against their outstanding invoices. Lenders provide an advance on a percentage of the accounts receivable, typically around 70-90% of the invoice value. Once the customer pays the invoice, the lender deducts their fees and releases the remaining amount to the business. Accounts receivable financing can help businesses access immediate cash flow from unpaid invoices.\n3. Inventory financing: Businesses with substantial inventory levels can leverage inventory financing to obtain working capital. Lenders assess the value of the inventory and provide a loan based on a percentage of its appraised worth. This type of loan helps businesses unlock the cash tied up in inventory, enabling them to purchase additional stock, manage seasonal fluctuations, or fund other operational needs.\n4. Short-term loans: Short-term working capital loans are designed to cover immediate financial needs over a relatively brief period, typically less than a year. These loans often have fixed repayment terms and are suitable for businesses requiring a lump sum amount to bridge a temporary cash flow gap, fund a specific project, or seize time-sensitive opportunities.\n5. Trade credit: Trade credit is a type of working capital loan extended by suppliers or vendors to their customers. It allows businesses to purchase goods or services on credit, deferring the payment until an agreed-upon later date. This form of financing can help businesses manage cash flow by extending payment terms while still accessing essential supplies.\n6. Merchant cash advance: This type of working capital loan is primarily applicable to businesses with significant credit and debit card sales. Lenders provide a lump sum amount upfront, which is repaid through a percentage of future card sales. Merchant [cash advances](https://razorpay.com/capital/cash-advance/) offer quick access to cash but often come with higher interest rates or fees.\n\n\nPlease note: It\u2019s important for businesses to carefully consider their specific financial needs, repayment capabilities, and the terms and conditions associated with each type of working capital loan before choosing the most suitable option. Consulting with financial advisors or loan specialists can help businesses make informed decisions and select the right type of working capital loan that aligns with their goals and requirements.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRequirements for obtaining working capital loans\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n1.

Cash flow projections: Lenders will want to see realistic cash flow projections to ensure that the business has sufficient income to meet loan repayment obligations. Accurate financial statements, including profit and loss statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets, may be required to support the loan application.\n4. Collateral: While working capital loans are typically unsecured, some lenders may require [collateral](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/collateral-business-financing/) to mitigate their risk. Collateral can be in the form of real estate, equipment, inventory, or other valuable assets. Providing collateral may improve the chances of loan approval and result in more favourable interest rates.\n5. Industry and business type: Lenders may have specific preferences or restrictions regarding the industries or business types they lend to. Certain [high-risk industries](https://www.crisil.com/en/home/our-businesses/crisil-market-intelligence-and-analytics/india-research/crisil-industry-research/industry-risk-scores.html) or businesses with cyclical revenue patterns may face additional scrutiny. It\u2019s essential to find a lender familiar with and supportive of your industry.\n\n\n\nEligibility criteria for working capital loans\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhile requirements may vary among lenders, some common eligibility criteria for working capital loans include:\n\n\n* Business must be legally registered and operational\n* Minimum annual revenue or monthly sales threshold\n* Adequate business and personal credit scores\n* Positive cash flow or a viable plan to achieve it\n* Demonstration of repayment ability through financial documents\n* Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements\n\n\nRequired documents for working capital loans\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhen applying for a working capital loan, it\u2019s essential to provide the necessary documentation to support your loan application.

It feels like this is how humans have existed for eternity. But it\u2019s not. The modern homo-sapiens (that means us!) have existed for roughly 3 lakh years, a small number compared to our beloved planet\u2019s age (4.54 billion years!). \n\n\nIt\u2019s astounding that the typewriter was invented just 155 years ago, and about a century later, the internet emerged. Given the rapid pace at which humanity has progressed and persevered, one would think that the signs were always there for Artificial Intelligence to present itself in some shape or form in the modern era. A world carefully engineered to satisfy even the most frivolous need one could have. And yet, it felt as if the world had stopped when [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) revealed its latest creation to the world.\u00a0\n\n\nThe ease with which ChatGPT solves day-to-day problems and helps people with their daily work has been nothing short of a miracle. It knows everything from deciphering complex code to delivering a good diet plan for your gut microbiome! It\u2019s almost amusing to consider that we have such potent technology readily accessible, especially when you remember that touchscreen phones only became widespread about a decade ago!\u00a0\n\n\nSo, how far can we go with using ChatGPT for technical writing? What role can AI play in\u00a0 the world of documentation? Mind you, documentation has also come a long way since Margaret Hamilton and her team wrote 145,000 lines of code by hand on large sheets of paper for the Apollo 11 Space Program in 1969 (the same year we got the internet!).\n\n\nMore with Less!\n---------------\n\n\nThe greatest selling point of an AI Chatbot like ChatGPT is the ease of use. You ask it a simple query (which could basically be anything!) and just like an all-knowing, all-seeing guru, it will scour the depths of the internet and curate answers most suited to satisfy your questions.\u00a0\n\n\n### Asking the Right Questions\n\n\nThe trick is to ask the right questions (with as many details as you can add) if you want a satisfactory response. To maximize interactions with AI language models like ChatGPT, specificity, and context are essential. Clear and specific queries guide the AI to appropriate responses, while contextual details help it understand your request better. Additionally, clarifying ambiguous terms reduces misunderstandings. AI models don\u2019t infer assumptions from sparse data, hence being explicit is advantageous. Decomposing complex inquiries into detailed questions also aids comprehension. Despite ChatGPT\u2019s vast data access, it lacks human-like reasoning, and thus some queries may not yield wholly satisfactory answers. Therefore, when using ChatGPT, be precise, contextual, explicit, and strategic with complex questions, and adjust your expectations for optimal responses.\n\n\nAs a writer, how can I leverage this ingenuity for my cause? Well, I figured I\u2019d pose this very question to ChatGPT itself! And so, I asked, \u201cHow can you help me with Technical Documentation?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s the response:  \n\n  \n\n*As an AI developed by OpenAI, I can assist with a wide range of tasks related to technical documentation, such as:*\n\n\n1. ***Drafting****: I can help generate first drafts of your technical documentation based on the information and guidelines you provide.*\n2. ***Editing****: If you have existing technical documentation that you need to refine or rewrite for clarity, I can assist with that.*\n3. ***Formatting****: I can provide guidance on best practices for technical documentation formatting, including the use of headers, bullet points, diagrams, and more.*\n4. ***Explaining Technical Concepts****: I can help break down complex technical concepts into simpler language, making your documentation more accessible to non-technical audiences.*\n5. ***Consistency Checking****: I can help check your technical documents for consistency in terms of terminology, style, and tone.*\n6. ***Code Documentation****: If you\u2019re working on a software project, I can help write comments and documentation for your code, explaining what different functions do and how they work.*\n7. ***Creating User Manuals or Guides****: I can assist in creating comprehensive user manuals or guides for software or hardware products.*\n\n\nThis is an exhaustive list of things it can do. Drafting, Editing, Formatting, and Checking form the core essentials of any writing role. It can not only do that but do it at an alarmingly fast pace.\n\n\nI\u2019d be lying to you if I said I have never used ChatGPT for my documentation work, from turning a sentence into an active voice to changing a sentence from first person to second person view. Of course, I can do all this alone; I wouldn\u2019t be much of a writer if I couldn\u2019t. But it would take longer to figure out the fine details. With AI however, I can just ask the question, and my query would be instantly resolved.\n\n\n![using chatgpt for technical writing](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-27-at-10.07.44-PM-1024x763.png)\n\n\nThe Essence of Time\n===================\n\n\nMore time in the documentation process yields numerous benefits.\n\n\n1. **Accuracy**: Extra time allows for meticulous research and validation, enhancing accuracy and preventing errors.\n2. **Detail**: A longer timeframe encourages more comprehensive and detailed documentation.\n3. **Review and Revision**: The luxury of extended duration facilitates numerous iterations, which can heighten clarity and reduce inaccuracies.\n4. **Organization**: It facilitates better document structuring, improving navigation and understanding.\n5. **Consistency**: You can maintain uniformity in style and terminology across documents.\n6. **Usability Testing**: It enables user testing for clarity and usability, and any feedback can be used for improvements.\n7. **Translation**: It ensures accurate and culturally sensitive translations if needed.\n8. **Feedback**: It allows gathering and incorporating user feedback to enhance document quality.\n\n\nAnd therein lies the most significant gift bestowed upon you by AI \u2013 the gift of time. You can 10x your productivity if you can learn how to use ChatGPT effectively. And that\u2019s how you could do more with less.\u00a0\n\n\nNot all Roses and Sunshine\n--------------------------\n\n\nAs you saw, when I asked ChatGPT how it could help me with Technical Documentation, it churned out a 7-point list describing in great detail how it could turn the proverbial wine into champagne. It did, however, also issue a brief disclaimer:  \n\n  \n\n*It\u2019s important to note that while I strive to provide accurate and helpful information, my responses should be cross-verified with other sources, especially in critical documentation. My knowledge cutoff is as of September 2021, and I won\u2019t have updates or changes in industry standards or technologies that have occurred since then.*\n\n\nWith the level of accuracy an AI chatbot now possesses, it would be impossible for someone to make out the difference between the work of a human being and an AI chatbot. You could even argue that ChatGPT wrote this whole blog, and it\u2019d be impossible to argue with.\u00a0\n\n\nBut even if the accuracy levels are very high, they are not 100%. An AI chatbot, while proficient, may occasionally err due to its lack of cognitive abilities, and fundamentally, it does not possess the complex capabilities of the human mind. At least not yet, anyway.\u00a0\n\n\nTechnology like this should be viewed as a tool that helps you optimize your work. But you should ensure you are not relying on it to do even the most menial tasks. It is important to assert control over your work; otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to make important decisions by yourself.\n\n\nWhat next?\n----------\n\n\nThese prospective advancements promise an exciting future, potentially introducing dramatic technological breakthroughs that could profoundly transform our lives. It is a smarter choice to put these advancements to work, make our lives easier, and invest time in solving more complex problems that require human intelligence and cognitive skills. It is your call to accept or ignore what is inevitable and use it best!", "[June 26, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/the-future-of-sme-loans-in-india-trends/)\n\n5 Mins Read\n\n\n***SME loans, also known as small and medium-sized enterprise loans, are financial products designed to provide funding and support to small and medium-sized businesses. These loans cater specifically to the unique needs and requirements of smaller businesses, which often face challenges in accessing traditional financing options.***\n\n\nThe SME sector in India has made a substantial contribution to the country\u2019s GDP, driven by the significant number of job opportunities it creates. In FY 2022, approximately [93,94,478](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/sme/msme-skil-govt-data-number-of-people-employed-by-udyam-msmes-doubled-in-fy21-from-previous-year-despite-covid/2463195/) workers were employed in these sectors. However, despite its undeniable significance, the sector faces challenges in accessing formal credit.\n\n\nAccording to the [BLinC Invest](https://blincinvest.com/news) MSME Lending Report 2022, financial institutions in India are only able to fulfil 15% of the total credit requirements of the sector.\n\n\nAs the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy, it is crucial for India to take prompt action in eliminating these obstacles. Fortunately, emerging trends and fintech solutions hold the promise of ushering in a new era of transformative change.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhy are the current lending protocols challenging for SMEs?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn India, a staggering [99.7%](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/gradual-shift-from-informal-to-formal-for-msmes/articleshow/91109053.cms?from=mdr) of small businesses operate within the unorganised sector, with around two-thirds of them not registered under government authorities. This poses a significant challenge for these businesses, as they are automatically rendered ineligible to apply for SME loans from traditional financial institutions and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).\n\n\nConsequently, the credit gap in the micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) industry has skyrocketed to an alarming [Rs. 25 trillion in 2022](https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/banks-nbfcs-meet-less-than-15-of-msme-credit-demand-11671035294728.html).\n\n\nThe absence of collateral or assets further compounds the difficulty for small businesses in obtaining formal credit funding. This leads traditional lenders to perceive SMEs as high-risk borrowers, resulting in loan rejections or imposing exorbitant interest rates.\n\n\nConsequently, small business owners find themselves seeking alternative [funding options](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/small-business-loan/) that can alleviate their liquidity crunch without adding financial burden.\n\n\nFortunately, some financial solution providers, such as Razorpay, are spearheading the development of advanced and borrower-friendly lending protocols. These platforms hold the potential to revolutionise the conventional operations of business loans in India if successfully implemented.\n\n\nFuture of SME loans in India: trends & predictions\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe future of [SME loans](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/sme-loan-eligibility/) holds several exciting developments that are poised to shape the landscape of small business financing in India. Here are the key factors that will influence the future of SME loans:\n\n\n1. 1. **Collaboration between fintech companies and traditional financial institutions:**  \n\t\n\tThe increasing prominence of digitisation and online transaction methods has prompted banks to explore partnerships with online fintech service providers. These collaborations have the potential to enhance SME loans disbursal. For example, leading integrated financial solutions providers are teaming up with reliable banks to offer state-of-the-art corporate credit cards. These credit cards feature easy transaction procedures and lenient regulations, catering to the cash flow needs of businesses.\n\t2. **A significant emphasis on automation:**  \n\t\n\tAutomation is set to play a significant role in the future of SME loans. Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping global big data analysis. With cutting-edge automation, lending mechanisms can be significantly simplified. Digitally verifiable data about potential borrowers will reduce the need for extensive documentation and accelerate loan application approval. Automation also allows lenders to minimise resource allocation without compromising quality, resulting in reduced operational costs and lower overhead fees for SME loan applicants.\n\t3. **Neo-banking facilities becoming commonplace:**  \n\t\n\tNeo-banking platforms, which operate solely online without physical branches, are gaining popularity among small businesses in India. These digitisation-centric banks offer competitive rates and have fewer policy restrictions compared to traditional banks. With user-friendly interfaces, these platforms enable a wide range of businesses to sign up for SME loans with minimal turnaround time.\n\t4. **Government initiatives:** The Indian government recognises the importance of the MSME sector and has implemented [various policies and initiatives](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/top-10-msme-loan-schemes-in-india-2023/) to support its growth. Schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) aim to improve access to finance for SMEs and reduce the credit gap.\n\n\n\nHow Razorpay is shaping the future of SME Loans in India:\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRazorpay is playing a pivotal role in simplifying the loan application process for small businesses and has the potential to shape the future of SME loans.

Users often read your documents or visit your documentation website to find specific information. Undoubtedly, search is of paramount importance if you want your users to read and refer to your knowledge base and help articles before they reach out to your Support team.\n\n\nWhy is search important?\n========================\n\n\nLet\u2019s understand this in a slightly different way. Why do organisations invest in developing documents? The goal is to provide easy and simple information about products, services and offerings. The benefits of doing so are two-fold.\n\n\n1. **Improves user experience**: Users refer to your documents and make a decision if they are prospective customers or complete their actions or get their queries resolved by reading your documents if they are your existing customers.\n2. **Reduce cost**: Support tickets can be reduced significantly (as much as 50%), and hence the overall operations cost of an organisation.\n\n\nBefore you write and design a search system, let\u2019s check who you write for.\u00a0\n\n\nYour Audience\n-------------\n\n\n* **Prospective users** can access information and knowledge about your brand and what services they can avail of.\n* **Existing users** read these documents to understand the products and features, terminologies, processes, workflows and how to perform specific tasks.\n* **Developers** read the API and integration documents to fire APIs and integrate them with your systems.\n* **Internal teams of the organisation** trying to understand the products better \u2013 Sales, Pre Sales, Support and Integrations Teams, New Joiners, and so on\n\n\nAs you see, documentation touches almost every participant in the system. Hence, designing excellent documentation is elementary. What if the information resides in your docs repository, but the users cannot find it? The entire purpose of developing docs fails!\n\n\n**Building a Flawless Search Experience**\n=========================================\n\n\nLet\u2019s accept it: Nobody reads product and developer documentation end-to-end. Users look for information, and **search** is the most natural way to find information on Google or by searching within your document or documentation website. So, you simply cannot afford to ignore this critical aspect of your documentation.\n\n\nBuilding a flawless search experience for your documents or documentation website requires 3 teams to work in tandem \u2013 Content, Design and Engineering.\n\n\n**Content**\n-----------\n\n\nThe content should be well structured with a scannable layout so that users can easily find information.\u00a0\n\n\n* Navigation: Table of contents, Indexing, website navigation and on-the-page navigation\n* Content Structure: Small paragraphs, scannable content, logically flowing in with appropriate headings and subheadings\n* Keywords: SEO-friendly keywords so that Google indexes your pages\n\n\n**Design**\n----------\n\n\nThe design is equally vital as a visually appealing and intuitive design helps the users come to the page, stay on the page and find information. The search design can include the following but is not limited to these:\n\n\n* Readable fonts, style, colours and design elements\n* What to show in the search results\n* Highlights for the search string in the content\n* The search window and the visual presentation of the search results\n\n\n**Engineering**\n---------------\n\n\nIntelligently designed algorithms and capabilities in your documents and documentation website list the relevant articles and search results most appropriate for the user\u2019s intent. Your algorithm should be smart enough to find the right content and provide appropriate recommendations.\n\n\n* Search results based on the Search String\n* Appropriate ranking of the search results\n* Autocorrection of the search string\n* Recommended/Auto-fill search strings\n* Saved searches\n* Recommended search based on Search History\n\n\nImagine your documents are comprehensive and aesthetically pleasing, but the search results don\u2019t show the correct articles.

Search is a vast, complex topic. We have taken an incremental approach to improving the search experience phase-by-phase.

The page you are browsing may have been haphazardly designed and might be guilty of information overload. Either the page could have too much text or too little, and might have been poorly structured.\u00a0\n\n\nJust when you think you\u2019ll try to get along with the page for the sake of the information, the page becomes more difficult to browse. The colours are non-complimentary or it has infinite media elements that make browsing feel cluttered and claustrophobic. You are out of patience and uncomfortable as the website is not friendly or accessible to you.\u00a0\n\n\nHow would you find your way out?\n\n\nWhat is Accessibility?\n======================\n\n\nAccessibility means different things to different people but is primarily motivated to provide comfortable usability to users, more so to disabled users. An accessible design enables any user of your target audience to use your product with ease despite any disabilities.\n\n\nUsability Vs. Accessibility\n---------------------------\n\n\nSo are they both the same? What is the difference between accessibility and usability, if any?\u00a0\n\n\nUsability, just as the name suggests, is the ability of the intended audience to use the product effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily under the conditions in which it is meant to be used. \n\n\nOn the other hand, accessibility specifically caters to people with disabilities and special conditions, for whom living by **what is considered** the usual norm is difficult.\u00a0Sometimes, usability practices do not account for disability and cause more harm than good. In such cases, taking care of accessibility creates an empathetic and inclusive design that is helpful to both disabled as well as abled users.\n\n\nWhy Web Accessibility is Important\n----------------------------------\n\n\nIt\u2019s understood that web accessibility plays a significant role in improving the user experience. But just how much does it help?\u00a0\n\n\n* With accessibility, you are ensuring that every user in your target audience, regardless of their abilities and disabilities, can **access your information easily**.\n* You include them, and that matters a lot. Inclusivity and empathy form a core aspect of web accessibility, which ultimately **improves customer satisfaction**.\n* When your customers are satisfied, they **trust your brand** more. This will help create a positive image of your brand, which helps with **user retention**.\n* Accessible websites **empower users**. They will engage with your content and provide meaningful perspectives that would benefit both the product and the users.\n* You are improving the usability of the site for all the users, without bias and presumptions.\n\n\nUltimately, this quote summarises why accessibility is paramount:\u00a0\n\n\n\n> As per W3C findings, accessibility overlaps with other best practices such as [mobile web design](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/), device independence, multi-modal interaction, usability, [design for older users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/), and search engine optimization (SEO). Case studies show that **accessible websites have better search results, reduced maintenance costs, and increased audience reach**, among other benefits.\n> \n> \n\n\nAccessibility in Technical Writing\n==================================\n\n\nThe prime objective of technical writing is to clearly communicate information to use a product. This document is relevant to the user, is easy to read and provides sufficient clarity.\u00a0\n\n\n***Here\u2019s an interesting tidbit****: If you are a technical writer, you are already engaged in the goals accessibility wants to achieve!*\n\n\nBy virtue, technical writing already encompasses one niche virtue of accessibility: usability. Some more are as follows:\u00a0\n\n\n* A technical document is **legibly structured and formatted** so that it can be read and easily understood.\n* It uses complex language **only to the extent necessary** for the target audience, not less, not more.\u00a0For example, a developer-facing document will contain developer-centric language like API parameters and types or integration guidelines.\n* It **clearly communicates** the product\u2019s usage and relevant information.\n* The document is written in **simple and straightforward language**. Users who are not proficient in the primary documentation language can still understand it.\n\n\nYes, your document is usable, but, does it mean your document is accessible too?\n\n\nThere will be some users who:\n\n\n* Find the **colour coding in your images illegible** because the user is colourblind.\n* Who does not have the dexterity to move the trackpad or the mouse freely finds your documentation herculean to access because **there are no keyboard shortcuts**.\n* Find the document poorly formatted. It may seem legible, but screen readers cannot **transcribe that document** into a more straightforward format.\n* Simple as the document language is, it is **not simple enough** for users to understand. Your content is not easily searchable online or when downloaded.\n\n\n**Too much is happening on your site when**:\u00a0\n\n\n* Gifs are moving everywhere.\n* Information coverage is very high and overly technical.\n* There are too many controls and buttons.\n\n\nAll of this overwhelms your user which leads to a lack of focus. They cannot read in peace and are distracted by your site.\n\n\nTechnical documents are the primary source of information for many users, particularly users with special needs and older users. If such a document alienates the user, the product becomes less reliable for them due to the lack of inclusivity. That is why accessibility is necessary.\u00a0\n\n\nHow Razorpay Adopted Accessibility in Technical Documentation\n=============================================================\n\n\nIn recent years, many organisations have put in efforts into making their websites and documentation portals accessible. W3C recommends [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) to help content creators, designers and developers to build accessible websites. It\u2019s not an enhancement anymore; it is a necessity.\n\n\n[Razorpay Docs](https://razorpay.com/docs/#home-payments), the publicly available documentation platform for its users, practices many such guidelines. The style guide provides stringent measures to ensure the documentation is user-sensitive and easy to scan.\u00a0\n\n\n* All the pages are **interspersed with diagrams, illustrations, videos and gifs** to make information consumable in as many ways as possible.\n* **Every information has an alternative mode of consumption**. You can either watch the video, refer to an image, or read along.\n\n\n![Accessibility ](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-26-at-14.14.56.png)\n\n\n* The videos available across most pages are **procedural**, have **intermittent callouts** to guide users, and **have closed captioning** enabled by default when they have voice-overs. Integration videos are a great example.\n* You can navigate the docs **using keyboard shortcuts**. For example, press \u2018/\u2019 (forward slash) and the Search window pops up.\n* The docs are **optimised for every device**: desktop, mobile, tablets; docs are easy to access.\n\n\n![Accessibility ](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-26-at-14.17.23-2.png)\n\n\n* Technical **jargon is sparingly used** to make the content accessible to a layman.\n* All **images are equipped with alt text**. For process diagrams where alt text is not sufficient or cannot be optimised, the workflow diagrams are explained in detail on a dedicated page. Also, all images can be zoomed in and out.\n\n\nThe Way Forward\n===============\n\n\nAccessibility is a necessity in the current world. By making design, writing, platforms and spaces accessible, you remove barriers to entry and promote inclusivity in the audience. With accessibility, you give users the autonomy to pursue information in their own way, **comfortably**.\n\n\nThe business case is strong. Accessible designs strengthen the documentation and future proof it. It is empathetic and bridges the gap most usability designs may not consider.\n\n\nGoogle rewards you for accessibility. Accessible documentation is SEO-friendly. When you make the website accessible and follow WCAG\u2019s recommendations for code and content, you improve your site\u2019s value according to Google\u2019s algorithm. As a result, Google ranks your website higher.\n\n\nWhat remains true throughout this is that making accessible documentation is a part and parcel of technical writing and documentation. Razorpay will continue to invest posthumously in this direction and bring in more capabilities and features on the platform so that every user can find and use the information with ease.\n\n\n**All that we do is for our users and each user is precious to us.**", "[June 23, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/what-is-document-version-control/)\n\n5 Mins Read\n\n\nImagine you are a scriptwriter. Your movie script has been picked up by a famous director, and you are excited. However, you have been asked to tweak it a bit to accommodate his artistic vision. Next, the producer wants some commercial elements, so you must also add those to the script. To appease his fanbase, the male lead wants changes in the script to capture his heroic escapades.\u00a0\n\n\nAs a scriptwriter, you are expected to collaborate with all these stakeholders and create a final version of the script. Without that being done, will everyone be able to share a common vision?\u00a0\n\n\nImagine, day one of the movie shoot, the director, the producer and the actor have different versions of the script with nothing in sync! This is the recipe for pure chaos.\n\n\nDocument version control is important, whatever may be the industry or the document type.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat is document version control?\n---------------------------------\n\n\nDocument version control is the process through which a document\u2019s journey from draft to final copy is tracked and managed. In today\u2019s digital world, where most information is maintained online, and cross-functional collaboration is the norm, [document versioning](https://technicalwriterhq.com/documentation/document-control/document-version-control/) is extremely important to maintain a single source of information.

While Shruti is updating the screenshots per the new UI, Raj is incorporating feedback from an external user. Both Shruti and Raj have their draft versions of an existing document. However, when publishing these content changes, they must ensure that both changes reflect on the final version. Without accurate, up-to-date documentation, the end user cannot accomplish their task.\n\n\nWhy is document version control needed?\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nDocument version control is crucial due to the following factors:\n\n\n1. Quality Control\n2. Collaboration\n3. Security and Compliance\n\n\n### Quality Control\n\n\nHaving multiple versions of a document floating around affects its quality as the authenticity of the information becomes questionable. With a versioning mechanism in place, it becomes easier to track all the changes made to the document and ensure that all stakeholders make up-to-date and correct information available at all times.\n\n\n### Collaboration\n\n\nVersion control comes in handy when multiple people are updating a document. Consider Google Docs. It provides an easy mechanism for stakeholders to work together on a document. It also maintains all these versions created by these different stakeholders so that one can go back and check who made a particular change to a document at any point in time. One can also revert to a specific document version \u2013 which means there is no scope for data loss.\n\n\n![document version control](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/06/collaboration.png)\n\n\n### Security and Compliance\n\n\nEnsuring that organisational policies and procedures are well-documented and regularly updated is vital. Having outdated information can cause compliance issues. By keeping track of different versions of a document, organisations can easily identify and access the version that was in effect at a specific point in time, which can be crucial for demonstrating compliance during audits or investigations.\n\n\nHow to Implement Version Control in Your Organisation\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n![document version control](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/06/sample-version-control.png)\n\n\n1. **Evaluate need**: Determine if your organisation needs a version control system. Identify the areas where your organisation can benefit from this system.\n2. **Set standards and versioning guidelines**: Set a standard process in place. For example, all documents should contain the following information on the first page:\n\t1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. Version number: Version numbers can begin from 0.1. Once the document is approved, the version can be 1.0. In case of subsequent edits, the numbering will be 1.1, 1.2, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Author details\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Summary of changes in that iteration of the document\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Date\n3. **Select a tool**: Choose the tool that would best meet your needs. Most organisations use tools such as Google Docs and Sharepoint for versioning. These tools also enable you to revert to a previous version. There are a host of tools out there for all types of needs.\n4. **Train members**: Once the system is in place, train your personnel on the process and the tool effectively.\n5. **Deploy and monitor**: Deploy the system and monitor how members are following the conventions.\n\n\n![document version control ](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/06/process.png)If you are managing a lot of content, such as User Guides, Admin Guides, Process Documents, API and SDK Documents, you will mostly have a Content Management System. In this scenario, a version control system is absolutely essential. Many organisations onboard a CMS tool with an in-built version control system, while others integrate their authoring systems with a version control tool. Based on your use case, choose the one that works best.\n\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\n\nDocument version control is a must for effective content management. It tracks changes, improves collaboration, maintains accuracy, and ensures the quality and accessibility of content. Adopting document version control can improve processes, increase productivity and reduce errors. Don\u2019t miss out on these benefits; consider implementing document version control in your organisation now.", "[June 23, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/working-capital/)\n\n5 Mins Read\n\n\n**What is Working Capital?**\n----------------------------\n\n\nIn accounting terms, working capital is the difference between a company\u2019s current assets and current liabilities. This difference is used to fund daily operations and meet short-term obligations.\n\n\nHaving the right balance of working capital is very important to the good financial health and performance of a business. Let\u2019s understand how working capital works and why exactly this financial metric is so important.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Understanding Working Capital**\n---------------------------------\n\n\n![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/06/working-capital-illustration-3.png)Working capital is calculated from the current assets and current liabilities of a business. The difference gives us the working capital.\n\n\n* Current assets include everything a business owns that can be converted into cash very quickly \u2013 the most liquid of assets, like market securities and deposits.\n* Current liabilities include those debts that mature within one operating cycle, like vendor payments or accounts payable.\n\n\nA negative working capital means the business runs the risk of defaulting on loans and low liquidity. This happens when the business has more current liabilities than current assets.\n\n\nA positive working capital means the business is able to fund its operations and growth. This happens when the business has more current assets than current liabilities.\n\n\nHowever, a very high positive working capital is also not a good thing. It means the business has too much idle cash sitting around, which could be put to better use, or that it has too much inventory that isn\u2019t moving fast enough.\u00a0\n\n\n**Components of Working Capital**\n---------------------------------\n\n\nWorking capital can be calculated from the difference between current assets and current liabilities. Both these values are found on the balance sheet of a company.\u00a0\n\n\n### **Current Assets**\n\n\nCurrent assets are the most liquid assets a company owns. \u201cLiquid\u201d here means that these assets can be converted into cash very quickly. They are unlike land or machinery, which are fixed assets and cannot be converted into cash very easily.\u00a0\n\n\nThey are found under the Assets section of the [Balance Sheet](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/balance-sheet/). Current assets include some or all of the following, depending on the type of business and industry of operations.\u00a0\n\n\n* Cash & Cash Equivalents\n* Accounts Receivable\n* Inventory\n* Marketable Securities\n\n\n### **Current Liabilities**\n\n\nCurrent liabilities are debts that mature within the next 12 months. They have to be paid off within a year or the business runs the risk of default. Generally, businesses use current assets like cash to pay off current liabilities.\u00a0\n\n\nThey are found under the Liabilities section of the Balance Sheet, and include some or all of the following.\n\n\n* Accounts Payable\n* Salary Payable\n* Dividend Payable\n* Accrued Tax Payable\n* Current portion of long-term debt\n\n\n**Working Capital Formula**\n---------------------------\n\n\nThe formula to calculate working capital is:\n\n\n**Working Capital = Current Assets \u2013 Current Liabilities**\n\n\nIf the final number is a negative value, it means that the current liabilities are more than the current assets. Negative working capital means that the company does not have enough liquid cash to cover its short-term debts and runs the risk of default.\u00a0\n\n\nIf the final number is a positive value, it means that the business does indeed have enough liquid cash to cover its short-term debts.\u00a0\n\n\n**Limitations of Working Capital**\n----------------------------------\n\n\nAlthough working capital is mostly a reliable indicator of short-term liquidity, there are some limitations that must be kept in mind when using this metric to gauge a business\u2019s performance.\u00a0\n\n\n* Working capital includes accounts receivable, which is an unreliable source of cash and cash equivalents, since the vendors might not pay the business back.\n* Businesses with a significant accounts receivable balance risk overestimating their cash and cash equivalents.\n* The daily liquidity of a business changes quite rapidly even over the span of one day.\n* By the time the assets and liabilities of the business are valued and recorded, the amounts might be obsolete. This may give an incorrect working capital value.\n\n\n**Working Capital Calculation**\n-------------------------------\n\n\n**ABC Manufacturing**\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Current Assets | Cash | 1,00,000 |\n|  | Inventory | 2,00,000 |\n|  | Accounts Receivable | 2,00,000 |\n| **Total Current Assets** |  | **5,00,000** |\n| Current Liabilities | Accounts Payable | 2,00,000 |\n|  | Short-term Debt | 1,00,000 |\n| **Total Current Liabilities** |  | **3,00,000** |\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nABC Manufacturing has current assets of Rs 5,00,000. They also have current liabilities of Rs 3,00,000. To calculate the working capital, subtract the current liabilities from the current assets:\n\n\nWorking Capital = Current Assets \u2013 Current Liabilities\n\n\nWorking Capital = Rs 5,00,000 \u2013 Rs 3,00,000\n\n\nWorking Capital = Rs 2,00,000\n\n\nIn this example, ABC Manufacturing has a working capital of Rs 2,00,000. This represents the amount of capital available to the company to fund its day-to-day operations and meet its short-term obligations.\u00a0\n\n\nThis positive working capital indicates that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, which is generally considered favourable for financial stability.\n\n\n**How Can a Business Improve its Working Capital?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSince working capital depends on the value of current assets and current liabilities, a surefire way to improve a business\u2019s working capital is to increase current assets and decrease liabilities.\u00a0\n\n\nOf course, this is in the case of a negative working capital, where the business\u2019s current liabilities are more than its current assets.\u00a0\n\n\n* Avoid debt as much as possible\n* Reduce expenses to the bare minimum\n* Build higher inventory reserves\n* Prepaying expenses for cash discounts\n* Reduce bad debts or debt write-offs by considering vendor credit repayment habits\n* Pay vendors on time to avoid fines or late fees\n\n\nThis last point is especially important since paying vendors on time is a surefire way of not only building trust with your vendors but also ensuring that you do not incur any extra expenses.\u00a0\n\n\nRazorpayX Vendor Payments is an automated tool to help businesses pay and manage their vendors seamlessly with very minimal manual input.\u00a0\n\n\nIt comes along with RazorpayX\u2019s other full-stack tools for startups, like Current Accounts, Corporate Credit Cards, Bulk Payouts, and more.", "[June 22, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/ezetap-is-now-razorpay-pos/)\n\n1 Min Read\n\n\n\n<https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/06/Razorpay-x-Ezetap-merger-Wordpress.mp4>", "[June 22, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/one-click-checkout-blog/)\n\n10 Mins Read\n\n\n*Updated on 22nd Sept, 2023*\n\n\nIn the realm of eCommerce, one-click checkout shines like the One Ring.

Similarly, UPI transactions require a UPI PIN for authentication purposes.\u00a0\n\n\nTherefore, while the term \u201cone-click checkout\u201d is used, it is more of a streamlined and expedited checkout process, and this expedited checkout is commonly coined as one-click checkout.\u00a0\n\n\nOne-Click Checkout- Understanding the Conversion Problem\n========================================================\n\n\n![One-Click Checkout- Understanding the Conversion Problem ](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/06/One-click-checkout-and-conversion-1024x586.png)\n\n\nOn one side, there are the titans, like Amazon and Flipkart, who wield the legendary one-click checkout, a feature born of their vast customer kingdoms and eons of data-driven wisdom. Their conversion rates soar like majestic eagles at 10%.\n\n\nOn the other side stand the valiant D2C (Direct-to-Consumer) brands, with smaller armies and fewer tales of optimization.

In contrast, one-click checkout streamlines the entire process into a single step, significantly reducing time and simplifying the experience.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s commonly seen on checkout pages is that a customer has to fill out multiple forms. As per Baymard, there are [11.8 form fields a customer has to fill on average](https://baymard.com/blog/checkout-flow-average-form-fields) before actually completing a purchase.

And one of the main reasons for cart abandonment is the complicated checkout process.\n\n\nCart abandonment, a lurking shadow in the world of online commerce, occurs when customers fill their carts but vanish from the online store without sealing the deal.\n\n\nYet, fear not, for one-click checkout is our Frodo, bearing the One Ring of simplicity. It vanquishes the need for lengthy forms and perilous account creation, streamlining the path to purchase. Customers, unburdened by frustration or impatience, complete their quests swiftly and without a second thought.\n\n\nAnd behold, as the journey becomes effortless, the allure of impulse purchases beckons. Like enchanted artifacts, they entice customers to part with their treasures, leading to a bountiful harvest of increased sales in this epic saga of online commerce.\n\n\nAlso, [18% of customers abandon their carts when they find the checkout process complicated](https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate). Hence, by minimizing the steps to complete the checkout process, an online store will increase their chances of customers shopping from them, meaning increased business revenue!\u00a0\n\n\n\nBoosts Customer Loyalty and Repeat Purchases\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nBy saving customers\u2019 information and purchase history, one-click checkout can provide a more personalized experience for customers. This can build a stronger relationship between the customer and the online store, increasing their loyalty and encouraging them to become repeat buyers.\n\n\nIn addition, one-click checkout can create a sense of [familiarity](https://razorpay.com/blog/familiarity-and-its-role-in-purchase-making-decisions/) and trust between the customer and the eCommerce business. By allowing returning customers to bypass the checkout process and use their saved payment and shipping information, the eCommerce business shows that it values and recognizes their customers. This can create a positive impression on the customer and increase the probability of them returning to the same store for future purchases.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHelps to Reduce Human Errors in the Checkout Process\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOne-click checkout reduces the chances of human errors by minimizing the manual data entry work required from the customer during the checkout process. With traditional checkout methods, customers are required to fill in their personal, payment, and shipping information manually. The manual work can increase the chances of human errors, such as typing errors, inputting incorrect contact or shipping information, etc.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, with one-click checkout, every detail gets prefilled, meaning customers only need to click on the checkout button and complete their order. One-click checkout takes care of filling out tedious forms.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFacilitates Mobile Shopping and Purchases\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nMobile shopping can be more complicated and time-consuming than shopping on a computer, especially when it comes to filling out forms and entering payment information.\u00a0\n\n\nMobile devices have smaller screens and less space to display information, making the checkout process challenging for customers. One-click checkout provides a user-friendly experience by displaying only the necessary information and making it easy for customers to navigate and complete their purchases on a mobile device.\n\n\nOne-click checkout can offer payment options optimized for mobile devices, such as mobile wallets like Google Pay, UPI, etc. These payment options make it easy for customers to complete their purchases quickly and securely on a mobile device.\n\n\nBy simplifying the checkout process, saving time, providing a user-friendly experience, and offering payment options optimized for mobile, one-click checkout can facilitate mobile shopping and purchases and make the overall shopping experience more convenient for mobile users.\n\n\nRazorpay Magic, a One-Click Checkout Solution: The Superhero of Your ECommerce Store\n====================================================================================\n\n\nRazorpay has been revolutionizing the eCommerce industry for nine years with its secure, customer-friendly, and intuitive checkout system.

It functions similarly to a credit card, where businesses can borrow funds up to a specific limit, repay them, and borrow again without needing to reapply for a new loan each time.\n\n\nThe importance of a line of credit for businesses lies in its flexibility and convenience. It offers a safety net for managing [cash flow fluctuations](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/overcome-cash-flow-probelms-in-a-business/), covering unexpected expenses, seizing growth opportunities, and addressing short-term financing needs.\n\n\nLine of credit can be secured or unsecured and understanding the difference between the two is crucial for businesses for several reasons. Firstly, it impacts the terms and conditions of the loan, including interest rates, repayment terms, and credit limits. Secondly, it determines the level of risk involved for both the borrower and the lender. Lastly, it influences the type and value of assets that may need to be pledged as [collateral](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/collateral-business-financing/).\n\n\nLet\u2019s delve deeper:\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n* [Understanding secured line of credit](#Understanding-secured-line-of-credit \"Understanding secured line of credit\")\n\t+ [Advantages of secured line of credit:](#Advantages-of-secured-line-of-credit \"Advantages of secured line of credit:\")\n\t+ [Disadvantages of secured line of credit:](#Disadvantages-of-secured-line-of-credit \"Disadvantages of secured line of credit:\")\n\t+ [Specific industries where secured line of credit is used:](#Specific-industries-where-secured-line-of-credit-is-used \"Specific industries where secured line of credit is used:\")\n* [Exploring unsecured line of credit](#Exploring-unsecured-line-of-credit \"Exploring unsecured line of credit\")\n\t+ [Advantages of unsecured line of credit:](#Advantages-of-unsecured-line-of-credit \"Advantages of unsecured line of credit:\")\n\t+ [Disadvantages of unsecured line of credit:](#Disadvantages-of-unsecured-line-of-credit \"Disadvantages of unsecured line of credit:\")\n\t+ [Specific industries where unsecured line of credit is used:](#Specific-industries-where-unsecured-line-of-credit-is-used \"Specific industries where unsecured line of credit is used:\")\n* [Key differences between secured and unsecured line of credit](#Key-differences-between-secured-and-unsecured-line-of-credit \"Key differences between secured and unsecured line of credit\")\n* [Factors to consider when choosing between secured and unsecured line of credit](#Factors-to-consider-when-choosing-between-secured-and-unsecured-line-of-credit \"Factors to consider when choosing between secured and unsecured line of credit\")\n* [Did you know?](#Did-you-know \"Did you know?\")\n\nUnderstanding secured line of credit\n------------------------------------\n\n\nSecured lines of credit are a type of financing arrangement where borrowers provide collateral as security against the loan. Collateral is an asset or property that the lender can claim if the borrower fails to repay the loan. This collateral serves as a guarantee, reducing the risk for the lender and allowing them to offer more favourable terms to the borrower.\n\n\nCollateral for secured lines of credit can take various forms, including:\n\n\n* Real estate: Residential or commercial properties, land, or buildings can be pledged as collateral.\n* Equipment: Machinery, vehicles, or specialised tools used in business operations.  \n\nInventory: Goods or products held by the business that have market value.\n* Accounts receivable: Outstanding invoices or payments owed to the business by customers.\n\n\nThe type of collateral accepted may vary depending on the lender and the specific terms of the loan. The value and liquidity of the collateral play a role in determining the credit limit or borrowing capacity of the line of credit.\n\n\n### Advantages of secured line of credit:\n\n\n1. Lower interest rates: Secured lines of credit generally come with lower interest rates compared to unsecured options. The collateral provides a level of security to the lender, reducing the risk of default, which translates into lower interest charges for borrowers.\n2. Higher borrowing limits: Since collateral is involved, lenders are often willing to extend higher credit limits, allowing businesses to access more substantial funds.\n3. Easier approval: Secured lines of credit are often more accessible for borrowers with lower credit scores or limited credit history, as the collateral mitigates the lender\u2019s risk.\n\n\n### Disadvantages of secured line of credit:\n\n\n1. Risk of collateral loss: The primary risk for borrowers is the potential loss of the collateral if they default on the loan. Failing to repay the loan can result in the lender seizing and selling the collateral to recover the outstanding debt.\n2. Documentation and evaluation: Obtaining a secured line of credit may involve more paperwork and documentation to evaluate the value, ownership, and condition of the collateral.\n\n\n### Specific industries where secured line of credit is used:\n\n\nSecured lines of credit are commonly used in industries where businesses have valuable assets that can be pledged as collateral. Some examples include:\n\n\n* Construction and real estate: Builders and developers often utilise secured lines of credit to finance projects and acquire land or properties.\n* Manufacturing and equipment financing: Businesses in manufacturing rely on secured lines of credit to purchase or lease machinery, tools, or equipment needed for production.\n* Retail and inventory management: Retailers may use secured lines of credit to finance inventory purchases, especially during peak seasons or promotional periods.\n* Service industries: Service-based businesses, such as consulting firms or healthcare providers, may leverage secured lines of credit to invest in technology, equipment, or facility expansions.\n\n\nUnderstanding the nuances of secured lines of credit allows businesses to make informed decisions about collateral, interest rates, credit limits, and overall risk. This knowledge empowers businesses to leverage the benefits of secured lines of credit while mitigating potential risks involved in borrowing against collateral.\n\n\nExploring unsecured line of credit\n----------------------------------\n\n\nUnsecured lines of credit are a type of financing that does not require borrowers to provide collateral. Unlike secured lines of credit, unsecured lines of credit rely primarily on the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness and financial standing as the basis for approval.\n\n\nUnsecured lines of credit are typically granted based on factors such as the borrower\u2019s credit history, credit score, income stability, and business financials. Lenders assess the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan based on these criteria, as there is no underlying collateral to serve as security.\n\n\n### Advantages of unsecured line of credit:\n\n\n1. No collateral requirement: The primary advantage of unsecured lines of credit is that borrowers are not required to pledge collateral, eliminating the risk of losing valuable assets in case of default.\n2. Quick access to funds: Unsecured lines of credit often have a faster application and approval process, allowing businesses to access funds quickly when needed.\n3. Flexibility: Borrowers have the freedom to use the funds from an unsecured line of credit for various business purposes without restrictions.\n\n\n### Disadvantages of unsecured line of credit:\n\n\n1. Higher interest rates: Unsecured lines of credit generally come with higher interest rates compared to secured options. Lenders compensate for the increased risk by charging higher interest rates to mitigate potential defaults.\n2. Lower credit limits: Without collateral as security, lenders may offer lower credit limits for unsecured lines of credit compared to secured options.\n3. Stricter eligibility requirements: Lenders impose stricter criteria for approving unsecured lines of credit, including higher credit score requirements, established business history, and stable income.\n\n\n### Specific industries where unsecured line of credit is used:\n\n\n1. Professional services: Businesses in sectors such as consulting, accounting, or legal services often rely on unsecured lines of credit to manage cash flow gaps, cover overhead expenses, or invest in business growth initiatives.\n2. Technology and innovation: Startups or businesses in the [technology industry](https://razorpay.com/blog/navigating-top-3-cash-flow-challenges-in-ed-tech/) may utilise unsecured lines of credit to finance research and development, purchase software or hardware, or support marketing efforts.\n3. Retail and e-commerce: Unsecured lines of credit can assist [retailers and e-commerce](https://razorpay.com/blog/e-commerce-business-razorpay-line-of-credit/) businesses in managing inventory, marketing campaigns, or expanding their online presence.\n4.

By considering the advantages and disadvantages, businesses can make informed decisions regarding the use of unsecured lines of credit to support their operations and growth.\n\n\nKey differences between secured and unsecured line of credit\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n![Secured Vs Unsecured Line of Credit](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/06/Beige-Aesthetic-Table-Mistakes-Instagram-Post-1024x1024.png)\n\n\nFactors to consider when choosing between secured and unsecured line of credit\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhen considering whether to opt for a secured or unsecured line of credit, businesses should carefully evaluate several factors to determine the most suitable option. Here are important considerations to keep in mind:\n\n\n1. Financial stability: Assess your business\u2019s financial stability, including cash flow, revenue, and profitability. A secured line of credit may be more appropriate if your business has fluctuating income or lacks a stable financial position. In contrast, a strong financial position may make you eligible for favourable terms with an unsecured line of credit.\n2. Collateral availability: Determine the availability and value of collateral assets. Secured lines of credit require collateral, such as real estate, equipment, or inventory, which can affect the borrowing limit and interest rates offered by lenders. If you have valuable assets that can serve as collateral, a secured line of credit may provide more favourable terms.\n3. Interest rates: Compare the interest rates associated with secured and unsecured lines of credit. Generally, secured lines of credit tend to have lower interest rates due to the presence of collateral, while unsecured lines of credit may come with higher interest rates to offset the increased risk for lenders. Consider the long-term implications of interest rates on your business\u2019s [financial health](https://razorpay.com/blog/razorpay-business-loan-emi-calculator/).\n4. Repayment terms: Evaluate the repayment terms offered by lenders for both types of credit lines. Factors to consider include repayment period, flexibility in repayment schedules, and the impact on your business\u2019s cash flow. Secured lines of credit often provide longer repayment periods, while unsecured lines of credit may have shorter repayment terms. Choose the option that aligns with your business\u2019s financial projections and ability to meet repayment obligations.\n5. Business needs and goals: Determine your specific business needs and goals that require financing. Consider whether you need a one-time lump sum for a specific project or ongoing access to funds for operational expenses. Assess the amount of funding required, the urgency of accessing funds, and the potential impact on your business\u2019s growth and profitability.  \n\nRisk Tolerance:\n6. Evaluate your risk tolerance as a business owner: Secured lines of credit provide a lower risk for lenders as they have collateral as security, but it means you could lose the collateral if you default on the loan. Unsecured lines of credit do not require collateral but involve higher risk for lenders and potentially higher interest rates for borrowers.\n\n\nDid you know?\n-------------\n\n\nRazorpay offers an unsecured line of credit to businesses.

It accounts for 35% of your overall score and is based on your track record of making payments on time.\n\n\n2. **Credit Utilisation:** This is the amount of credit you are using compared to the amount of credit available to you. This accounts for 30% of your credit score and it\u2019s important to keep your credit utilisation ratio below 30%.\n\n\n3. **Length of Credit History:** This is the average age of your credit accounts. The longer you have had credit accounts open, the better your score will be. This accounts for 15% of your credit score.\n\n\n4. **Credit Mix:** This is the variety of credit accounts you have.

This can help improve your score.\n\n\n4. **Monitor your credit score:** Track your credit score consistently to monitor your progress.

These assets are bought with the expectation of generating returns on risk capital.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the case of asset-backed lending, companies use previous assets as collateral for the loan. For a cash flow loan, the creditworthiness or the credit score of the company backs the loan.\u00a0\n\n\n**Understanding Financial Leverage and Its Importance**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThere are three options available for a company to finance its purchases. They use equity, debt, and leases to undertake new investments and projects. Businesses use leverage finance to invest in their future and to increase shareholder value. It is a much safer option than issuing stocks to raise capital for purchases.\u00a0\n\n\nFinancial leverage helps both investors and owners of companies. For example, investors use it to get the maximum return on investment. It is possible by using options, futures, and margin accounts to leverage their investments. In contrast, business owners use this to finance their assets. They use debt financing to invest in their business operations.\n\n\n**Examples of Financial Leverage**\n----------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Financial Leverage for a Company**\n\n\nSuppose a company uses \u20b910,00,000 of its cash and a loan of $90,00,000 to buy a new factory worth a total of \u20b91 Cr. If this new factory generates \u20b915,00,000 in annual profit, it means that it uses financial leverage to generate a profit of \u20b915,00,000 on a cash investment of \u20b910,00,000. This means the investment in the factory generates a 150% return on its investment.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Financial Leverage for Personal Finances**\n\n\nSuppose an investor has \u20b92,00,000 of their own money to invest. They take an extra amount of \u20b920,00,000 as a loan from a bank at the interest rate of 6%. Next, they invest the whole \u20b922,00,000 in an investment fund that has an annual return of 15% per year.\u00a0\n\n\nThis means at the end of the financial year, the investment generated a \u20b93,30,000 return. If we subtract the interest on the borrowed money, which is \u20b91,20,000, and the initial investment of \u20b92,00,000, the net gain from this investment stands at \u20b910,000. In other words, \u20b910,000 is the financial leverage.\n\n\n**How to Calculate Financial Leverage?**\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Total-Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio**\n\n\nThe Total-Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio is a financial metric that helps to understand how many degrees of a company\u2019s assets are funded by debt. To calculate the ratio, one must divide the company\u2019s total debt by total assets.\u00a0\n\n\nThe formula to calculate the ratio is:\n\n\nThe Total-debt-to-assets Ratio = Total Debt \u00f7 Total assets\n\n\nTo find the equity-to-asset ratio companies can subtract the result by 1.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio**\n\n\nThe debt-to-equity ratio is a financial leverage metric to compare what the company has borrowed against what it has raised from private investors. If the ratio is greater than one, it means that the company has more debt than equity. The metric varies for each company or industry.\u00a0\n\n\nThe formula of the Debt-to-Equity Ratio is:\u00a0\n\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt \u00f7 Total Equity\n\n\n* ### **Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio**\n\n\nEBITDA or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation helps to track the underlying profitability of companies. Businesses use this ratio to understand if the debt concerning operating income is controllable or not.\u00a0\n\n\nIf a company has a high debt-to-EBITDA, it means that the company has more debt than what it makes. The more leverage it is carrying the higher this ratio will be.\u00a0\n\n\nThe formula for this ratio is:\n\n\nDebt-to-EBITDA = Total Debt \u00f7 Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation\n\n\n* ### **Equity Multiplier**\n\n\nThe equity multiplier is calculated by dividing total assets by total equity. It helps to understand the ownership weightage of a company by analysing how its assets have been financed.\u00a0 If a company has a low equity multiplier it means that it has financed a large portion of its assets with equity. Thus, meaning that it is not a highly leveraged company. The equity multiplier formula is:\u00a0\n\n\nEquity Multiplier = Total Assets \u00f7Total Equity\n\n\n* ### **Degree of Financial Leverage**\n\n\nThe Degree of financial leverage is calculated by dividing the change in the percentage of a company\u2019s earnings per share by its earnings before interest and taxes. The main goal of calculating this degree is to understand the sensitivity of a company\u2019s earnings per share. A business with a higher DFL indicates a higher degree of leverage.\n\n\nThe formula for the degree of financial leverage is:\n\n\nDegree of Financial Leverage = Percentage Change in Earnings Per Share \u00f7 Percentage Change in net earnings before interests or taxes.\n\n\n**What is a Good Financial Leverage Ratio?**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nA good financial leverage ratio depends on the personal preference of the investor and the company. Some investors like a bit of risk and see leverage as an opportunity. Whereas other investors discredit the idea of risk.\u00a0\n\n\nIf a company has a debt-to-equity ratio of more than 1, it means that the company has a greater risk of debt obligations.\u00a0\n\n\n**Advantages and Disadvantages of Financial Leverage**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n* **Advantages**\n\n\nBusiness owners and investors use this leverage to increase their profit margins. Investors can earn more profits by using leveraged finances along with the initial upfront capital. Leveraged finances provide investors with the means to invest in more expensive and better investment options.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Disadvantages**\n\n\nUsing financial leverage to fund investments involves massive downside risks. Depending upon the investment, it sometimes results in huge losses more than the initial capital investment. Investors should have an extensive idea about their financial positions and the investment option they want to invest in.\n\n\n**Financial Leverage vs Margin**\n--------------------------------\n\n\nMargin is a type of financial leverage in which existing cash and securities are used as collateral to increase investors buying power. It allows investors to borrow capital from a broker to purchase securities, options, or futures contracts. They borrow this money in anticipation that they would receive higher returns in the future.\u00a0\n\n\nMargin is a type of financial leverage that helps to increase buying power.\u00a0\n\n\nExample: If an investor needs \u20b9100,000 in collateral to purchase \u20b910,00,000 worth of securities, they can get a 1:10 margin.\n\n\n**Contribution of RazorpayX in Helping Businesses to Invest**\n\n\nRazorpayX is a new-age business banking platform that helps businesses to conduct their financial operations with ease.

It is based on the financial reports audited by accountants and published by companies to be transparent to their shareholders.\n\n\nAn important area of corporate analysis is to generalise a company\u2019s past performance, such as earnings or margins. It will help to estimate the company\u2019s future performance. This type of historical trend analysis is beneficial for identifying seasonal trends.\n\n\n* **Investment Financial Analysis**\n\n\nThis is another method of financial analysis in which analysts evaluate the profitability, risk, and return of an investment opportunity. Investment analysis includes selecting the type of investment based on an investor\u2019s needs. Analysts study past returns and evaluate individual securities to predict future performance, risks, yield potential, and price movements.\n\n\n**What are the Types of Financial Analysis?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Fundamental Analysis**\n\n\nFundamental Analysis is the analysis of a business\u2019s financial statements to determine the intrinsic value of a business\u2019s stock. It helps in identifying the key attributes of a business and analysing its actual worth. There are mainly three sets of reports used in financial analysis- historical data, publicly known information, and information that is not public.\n\n\n* ### **Technical Analysis**\n\n\nTechnical analysis is a financial analysis methodology that uses statistical trends from trading activity to evaluate investment opportunities. Technical analysis examines past market data, price and volume of stocks to understand the viability of the business.\n\n\nThere are many methods of technical analysis but technical analysts mostly use bar charts, candlestick charts, line charts, and point and figure charts. These types of charts and graphs help analysts to denote patterns and trade signals.\n\n\n**Financial Analysis Techniques**\n---------------------------------\n\n\nAnalysts primarily use vertical and horizontal methods while conducting financial analysis. These analyses are performed by comparing the data against a baseline benchmark.\n\n\nOther essential financial analysis techniques include regression analysis and year-over-year growth analysis. Apart from these analyses, there is top-down analysis like the market share percentage and bottom-up analysis like the revenue driver analysis.\n\n\n**Horizontal Analysis vs Vertical Analysis**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Horizontal Analysis**\n\n\nIt is a type of financial analysis in which analysts look at financial trends over a period. In this analysis, financial data for one year is selected as the baseline against which all the accounts of companies are compared for each year. Subsequently, it shows a percentage that denotes which accounts are growing and which are shrinking.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Vertical Analysis**\n\n\nIn vertical analysis, a specific line item is chosen as a benchmark. Then every other component of a financial statement is compared to that benchmark. Most analysts use net sales as the benchmark and compare it to the cost of goods sold, gross profit, operating profit, and net income.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAnalysts use percentages for vertical analysis, as it makes the data easier to visualise. Companies then track these percentage changes over time and take business decisions accordingly.\n\n\n**Examples of Financial Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n\n* **Current Ratio Analysis Example**\n\n\nThere are two companies from which an investor wants to invest. Company A has current assets worth \u20b92 Cr. and current liabilities worth \u20b91 Cr. Whereas Company B which is a much bigger company has current assets of \u20b95 Cr. and current liabilities of \u20b93.5 Cr.\u00a0\n\n\nAnalysts use the current ratio formula to determine which is a better company to invest in.\n\n\nThe formula of the current ratio is:\n\n\nCurrent ratio = current assets / current liabilities\n\n\nThe current ratio of Company A = 2 Cr. / 1 Cr. = 2\n\n\nThe current ratio of Company B = 5 Cr. / 3.5 Cr. = 1.43\n\n\nAccording to the analysis, Company A has a current ratio of 2 and Company B has a current ratio of 1.43. This means Company A is in a much better financial position than Company B and it can repay any current debts or obligations much faster.\n\n\n* **Profitability Ratio Analysis Example:**\n\n\nCompany A has an operating profit of \u20b950,000 and net sales of \u20b92,00,000. In contrast, Company B has an operating profit of \u20b91,00,000 and net sales of \u20b94,00,000. To determine which company to invest in, analysts calculate the profitability ratio.\u00a0\n\n\nProfitability ratio = operating profit / net sales x 100\n\n\nThe Profitability ratio of Company A = 50,000 / 2,00,000 x 100 = 25%\n\n\nThe Profitability ratio of Company B = 1,00,000 / 4,00,000 x 100 = 25%\n\n\nBased on the profitability ratio analysis, both of these companies have the same profitability ratio of 25%.\u00a0\n\n\n**Why are Businesses Choosing RazorpayX to Manage Their Business Finances?**\n\n\nRazorpayX is a business banking suite that offers several integrated automated systems to manage finance.

It is carried out to achieve the desired risk and return profile. The main goal of this process is to balance the risk and reward potential of an investment portfolio.\n\n\nDifferent asset classes have different levels of risk and return characteristics. For example, stocks are generally considered more volatile but offer higher potential returns. In contrast, bonds are typically less volatile but provide lower potential returns.\n\n\n**Different Types of Asset Classes Used in Allocation**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Stocks**\n\n\nStocks are shares of publicly traded companies that can offer potential long-term growth but come with higher volatility and risk.\n\n\n* ### **Bonds**\n\n\nFixed-income securities are issued by governments or corporations. It typically provides regular interest income and is considered less risky than stocks.\n\n\n* ### **Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents are liquid assets, such as petty cash, savings accounts or short-term treasury bills. It provides stability and immediate access to funds.\n\n\n* ### **Alternative Investments**\n\n\nOther alternative asset classes are real estate, commodities, or private equity, which can offer diversification and potentially higher returns. However, it often comes with higher risk and limited liquidity.\n\n\n**Importance of Asset Allocation**\n----------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Risk Management**\n\n\nAsset allocation helps manage risk by diversifying investments across different asset classes. If one asset class performs poorly, the losses may be mitigated by gains of other asset classes, thereby reducing the overall risk of the portfolio.\n\n\n* ### **Return Optimisation**\n\n\nThe process of asset allocation allows investors to optimise their portfolio\u2019s return potential. For this, investors allocate investments to different asset classes that have different return patterns. As a result, they are able to capture growth opportunities and increase the overall return of their portfolio.\n\n\n* ### **Creation of Long-Term Wealth**\n\n\nThis method is crucial for long-term wealth creation. It helps investors align their portfolios with their financial goals and investment horizon. By diversifying across different asset classes, investors can benefit from the compounding growth potential of their investments over time.\n\n\n* ### **Adapting to Changing Market Conditions**\n\n\nAsset allocation enables investors to adapt to changing market conditions by regularly reviewing and adjusting the allocation of assets. It also allows taking control of market opportunities. Investors can rebalance their portfolios to ensure they are aligned with their investment objectives and the prevailing market conditions.\n\n\n**Various Types of Asset Allocation Strategies**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Strategic Asset Allocation**\n\n\nThis approach involves establishing a target asset allocation based on the investors\u2019 long-term financial goals. It also considers their risk tolerance and investment arena. During allocation, it looks at the past risk and return characteristics of different asset classes. After that, one must perform a timely portfolio rebalancing process to maintain the desired asset allocation results.\n\n\nPortfolio rebalancing involves selling assets that have increased value and buying assets that have underperformed to bring the portfolio back to its target allocation.\n\n\n* ### **Tactical Asset Allocation**\n\n\nTactical asset allocation involves making adjustments to the asset allocation based on short-term market conditions or forecasts. It aims to take advantage of ongoing market opportunities or to reduce potential risks. This strategy requires active monitoring of market trends and economic indicators\n\n\n* ### **Dynamic Asset Allocation**\n\n\nDynamic asset allocation is an investment strategy that involves actively adjusting the allocation of investments based on ups and downs in market conditions. Since it does not remain fixed over time, dynamic asset allocation allows for flexibility and responsiveness. It helps to capitalise on potential opportunities or mitigate risks.\n\n\n* ### **Life-Cycle or Age-Based Asset Allocation**\n\n\nAge-based or life-cycle asset allocation, also known as target-date asset allocation, is a strategy that adjusts the allocation of assets in a portfolio based on an investor\u2019s age or expected retirement date. This strategy enables investment goals and risk tolerance to typically change as an investor progresses through different life stages.\n\n\n**How Does Asset Allocation Work?**\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Understanding Business Goals**\n\n\nThe first step in asset allocation is to identify investment goals and assess risk tolerance. Business goals may include objectives such as capital appreciation, income generation, or capital preservation. Risk tolerance refers to an investor\u2019s willingness and ability to tolerate fluctuations in the value of investments. Understanding goals and risk tolerance will help one take better asset allocation decisions.\n\n\n* ### **Identification of Asset Classes**\n\n\nAsset classes are broad categories of investments that exhibit similar characteristics and behaviours. Each asset class has different risk and return profiles. Stocks, for example, are generally more volatile but offer higher potential returns. In contrast, bonds tend to be more stable but provide lower potential returns.\n\n\n* ### **Set Target Allocation**\n\n\nUpon identification of asset classes, a company needs to determine the target allocation for its portfolio. Target allocation refers to how much percentage of the portfolio has been allocated to each asset class. This allocation should be based on investment goals, risk tolerance, and a specified timeline.\n\n\n* ### **Implementation of the Strategies**\n\n\nAfter setting the target allocation, businesses need to implement it by actually investing in the selected asset classes. This can be done by purchasing individual securities, such as stocks and bonds. One can also invest in funds that provide exposure to specific asset classes, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\n\n* ### **Monitor and Rebalance**\n\n\nAsset allocation is not a one-time decision. It requires ongoing monitoring and periodic rebalancing. Market fluctuations can cause the value of different asset classes to deviate from their target allocation percentages. Rebalancing involves periodically adjusting your portfolio to bring it back to the desired allocation ratio.\n\n\n* ### **Review and Adjust**\n\n\nRegularly review investment portfolio and asset allocation strategy to ensure they remain aligned with the goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions. Over time, business circumstances, analytics and market dynamics may change, necessitating adjustments to asset allocation.\n\n\n**How Does RazorpayX Help Businesses with Allocation of Assets?**\n\n\nRazorpayX is a banking suite offering comprehensive banking assistance to business owners.

It includes the management, study and analysis of money and investments.\n\n\nFinance plays a very important role in today\u2019s society and economy. It helps in trade, economic systems and the allocation of resources. Understanding finances helps people make prudent, wise financial decisions.\n\n\n**History of Finance in India**\n-------------------------------\n\n\nFinance in India can be traced back to the 4th Century BCE \u2013 ancient India had a well-established financial system supported by lending, borrowing and a robust trading economy.\u00a0\n\n\nThe modern Indian banking system began to take shape in the early 20th century, which was when the sector witnessed many important milestones.\u00a0\n\n\nThe RBI was founded in 1935 as the central banking authority to regulate the banking sector. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates and enforces policy for the capital markets.\n\n\nIn recent years, India has become home to the best financial technology (fintech) and advancements in digital payment technology in the world. Fintech firms like RazorpayX and Paytm have revolutionized the financial sector.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Types of Finance**\n====================\n\n\nThere are many different types and uses of finance across industries and sectors. Regardless of what industry you\u2019re operating in, you will have to deal with finance in one way or another.\u00a0\n\n\n[**Corporate Finance**](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/corporate-finance-guide/)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe management of money for businesses and profit-making organisations is called corporate finance. Corporate finance works to allocate financial resources efficiently, balance risk and return and achieve growth and profitability.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are many specializations under the umbrella of corporate finance: capital budgeting, capital structure management, working capital management, dividend policy, mergers and acquisitions, IPOs and more.\n\n\nCorporate Financing is different from Corporate Finance. Corporate Financing is when a business acquires financing in the form of investment, loans or proceeds from an IPO. It is an area of focus under Corporate Finance.\u00a0\n\n\nCorporate Banks help businesses acquire financing \u2013 they manage a company\u2019s IPO or reissue of shares. They also help companies with mergers and acquisitions, which require a great deal of financial analysis and calculations.\u00a0\n\n\n### Corporate Finance in Real Life\n\n\nThe best example of corporate finance is Walmart\u2019s acquisition of Flipkart. Both companies conducted detailed financial analyses, assessed growth prospects, and considered market dynamics to arrive at a fair value for Flipkart.\u00a0\n\n\nWalmart arranged for a carefully planned mix of debt and equity to fund the acquisition \u2013 this financial structure planning is also part of corporate finance.\u00a0\n\n\nPost-acquisition integration between Flipkart and Walmart is another important facet of corporate finance \u2013 analysts and bankers had to consider the synergies and operational efficiencies that could be achieved by combining Flipkart\u2019s e-commerce expertise and market reach with its own retail expertise and global resources.\n\n\n**Personal Finance**\n--------------------\n\n\nPersonal Finance is anything related to money planning and management for the individual. It depends largely on the income earned by the individual, his financial goals and priorities.\u00a0\n\n\nPersonal finance is an umbrella term for a number of needs and requirements: personal credit cards, personal loans, investments and deposit accounts and more. Banks that provide these financial services to the individual are called Retail Banks or Commercial Banks.\u00a0\n\n\nSome commercial banks in India include SBI, ICICI and HDFC Bank. All these banks also provide corporate banking services, since corporate banking is the most profitable pillar of banking.\u00a0\n\n\nPersonal finance management helps individuals achieve financial goals, achieve financial stability and build long term wealth. It is an important skill for every individual to have, since financial stability contributes to overall quality of life and well-being.\u00a0\n\n\n**Public Finance**\n------------------\n\n\nThe management of public funds by governments and governmental agencies to promote economic growth, social welfare and development is called public finance.\u00a0\n\n\nPublic finance helps governments allocate resources, and tailor fiscal policy. It involves the management of government revenues, expenditures and debt, as well as taxation and the country\u2019s banking system.\u00a0\n\n\nThe role public finance plays in society is immense: it helps prevent market failure and keeps prices in check. Economists and analysts make use of insights from public finance to understand the movement of money within the economy.\u00a0\n\n\nPublic finance is closely interlinked with the other tenets of finance since it influences the entire economy.\u00a0\n\n\n**Social Finance**\n------------------\n\n\nWhen finance is used to generate positive social or environmental impact, and not primarily for a profit-making purpose, it comes under the umbrella of social finance.\u00a0\n\n\nIt involves deploying capital to address social issues, support sustainable development and promote positive change in society. It is used by NGOs, charitable organizations, governments and foundations.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are many ways that social finance manifests in the economy. When an individual or company decides to invest in a good cause, it conducts several analyses to understand the social or environmental impact of the investment. This is a kind of social finance.\u00a0\n\n\nSocial finance also includes loans given by banks and investors to small businesses that may or may not seem very profitable \u2013 these loans are not given with the intention of bringing in high returns, but instead to promote self-employment at the MSME level. This benefits society at large but doesn\u2019t necessarily bring profits for the lender.\u00a0\n\n\n**Behavioural Finance**\n-----------------------\n\n\nBehavioural finance aims to explain how individuals and markets make financial decisions. It combines psychology, finances and economics to understand human behaviour, cognitive bias and decision-making.\u00a0\n\n\nSome key concepts that behavioural finance explores are cognitive biases, behavioural bias in market pricing, market bubbles and crashes, and more. Behavioural finance is used to supplement the other pillars of finance \u2013 corporate or personal in order to understand the system at a deeper level.\u00a0\n\n\nBy acknowledging and accounting for behavioural biases, investors and financial professionals can make more informed decisions and develop strategies that align with the realities of human behaviour.\n\n\n**Areas of Finance**\n--------------------\n\n\nFinance is such a widely used field that it is never used in isolation \u2013 finance is usually paired with other fields like economics, accounting and investment.\u00a0\n\n\n### Economics and Finance\n\n\nThe use of finance within the broader study of economics is vast. Economics is the study of scarce resources, and how they are allocated within a limited population. It studies how people and populations make decisions to allocate these scarce resources to satisfy their unlimited wants and needs.\u00a0\n\n\nFinance and economics work together to explain, measure and predict how today\u2019s society works. Economic principles provide the theoretical framework for financial decision-making and analysis.\u00a0\n\n\nThe two fields inform each other, with economic principles guiding financial strategies and financial outcomes influencing economic outcomes.\n\n\n### Accounting and Finance\n\n\nAccounting is the recording, analysis and reporting of financial transactions. It applies to individuals, businesses and governments. Accounting creates a database of financial information from which interpretations and decisions can be made.\u00a0\n\n\nWithout this reliable, accurate and extensive framework of financial information, the field of finance would be non-existent. Financial data provided by accounting forms the basis for financial analysis, budgeting, financial forecasting, and decision-making in finance.\n\n\nFinance uses the information provided by accounting to assess various aspects like profitability, project future performance and develop strategies to optimize financial management.\u00a0\n\n\n### Investment and Finance\n\n\nWhen money is allocated to certain assets or financial instruments with the intention of generating a return or profit over time, it is an investment.\u00a0\n\n\nInvestment is an important part of finance \u2013 it is the best way to use idle money and keeps the economy running and people wealthy. Investors need to assess opportunities, analyze risk and reward and make informed decisions to maximise gains.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are many kinds of investments \u2013 stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities and more. Together, investment and finance play vital roles in optimizing financial outcomes for individuals, businesses, and institutions.\u00a0\n\n\n**Finance as a Science**\n------------------------\n\n\nScience is defined as a field of study that is universal, systematic and organized. It is based on theory and principles that can be proved through experimentation.\u00a0\n\n\nFinance satisfies all these key characteristics, and many modern financial theories rely on hard sciences like statistics and mathematics. Without scientific backing, most financial principles and theories would not exist.\u00a0\n\n\n**Finance as an Art**\n---------------------\n\n\nWhile finance does depend on science and mathematics for a lot of its principles and theories, there is still a subjective and creative side to it. This makes finance just as much an art as it is a science.\u00a0\n\n\nFinance tries to explain how people handle money, and the behaviour of humans can never be explained entirely scientifically. There will always be an element of intuition and judgement to financial decisions and thus financial policy and analysis.\u00a0\n\n\n**Finance as a Social Science**\n-------------------------------\n\n\nSince finance draws on scientific principles and mathematics \u2013 but also depends on qualitative factors like human behaviour and market sentiment, it cannot be called a pure science like chemistry or biology. Instead, it is defined as a social science.\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, the stock market works on the mathematical principles of demand and supply but this demand and supply depends on the irrational judgement of human beings. Many stock market crashes have happened as a result of irrational fear and panic amongst investors.\n\n\n**Finance Careers**\n-------------------\n\n\nThere are many professional careers under the umbrella of finance. To pursue a career in finance, certain skills and qualifications are required: you will need a college degree in finance or accounting.\u00a0\n\n\nAn MBA or masters degree in finance is also very helpful for a successful career in finance. Budding accountants study for and have to pass an exam for Chartered Accountants.\u00a0\n\n\nHere are a few careers commonly associated with finance:\n\n\n**Financial Analyst**\n\n\nA financial analyst is a professional who works to draw interpretations from financial data and help companies, individuals or organizations make decisions.\n\n\nThey help in decision making relating to investment, turnover, risk, financial projections and more. Their services are an absolute must wherever money is involved \u2013 which essentially is everywhere.\u00a0\n\n\n**Accountant**\n\n\nAn accountant creates and tracks a company\u2019s financial information, and is responsible for the accurate, timely and reliable reporting of accounts.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are many sub-fields of accounting \u2013 corporate accounting, tax accounting, management accounting and more.\u00a0\n\n\n**Auditor**\n\n\nAn auditor ensures that financial records are accurate and reliable. They work with companies or governments to ensure accuracy, compliance, and transparency.\n\n\nAuditors play a crucial role in providing independent and objective assessments of an organization\u2019s financial practices, internal controls, and risk management processes.\n\n\n**Banker**\n\n\nA banker is someone who works for a bank in any of its various functions \u2013 lending, investments, deposits, accounts and more.\u00a0\n\n\nThey help with the smooth running of banks, which are play a central role in our economy. Investment bankers help businesses with mergers and acquisitions or raising capital through IPOs or reissue of shares.\u00a0\n\n\n**The Future of Finance**\n-------------------------\n\n\nThe rise of fintech, artificial intelligence and digital currencies has almost completely changed the way we see finance today.\u00a0\n\n\nFintech in particular has had a significant impact on all sectors of finance \u2013 from personal to public. Platforms like Paytm and RazorpayX have disrupted banking and payments to almost unrecognizable levels.\u00a0\n\n\nToday, people make payments without involving a single bill of cash, and businesses make bulk payouts with just a single click of a mouse!\n\n\nRazorpayX is a suite of financial solutions to all the problems startups and businesses face in India. Vendor payments, credit cards, payouts, and banking \u2013 RazorpayX is the bridge between financial management and banking.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is the meaning of finance?\n\n\n\nFinance is an umbrella term for all things concerning money.

There are many different ways and techniques of calculating the valuation of a company, depending on the reason for valuation.\u00a0\n\n\nAn analyst takes several factors into consideration when calculating the value of a company \u2013 the market value, capital structure, future projections, management structure and more.\n\n\nThe value of a company can be calculated for many reasons. The most common reason is sale of assets or sale of the business itself. In times of divestiture or sale, it is important to know if the business or its assets are overvalued or undervalued so the management can get the best price possible.\n\n\nUnderstanding Valuation\n-----------------------\n\n\nFundamentally, valuation is determined by comparing what the buyer is willing to pay and what the seller is willing to accept. There are two kinds of value that can be calculated for an asset:\n\n\n### Fair Value\n\n\nThis is the value of an asset that is mutually agreed upon by both buyer and seller. It is measured by taking into consideration the market value of the asset, its growth potential and projected future performance.\n\n\nIt may not be the true value of the asset, because the perception of the buyer and seller and overall market demand play an important role in determining the fair value of an asset.\n\n\n### Intrinsic Value\n\n\nThe intrinsic value is the true, actual value of an asset independent of its market value. The goal is to determine the value that the asset should have based on its fundamentals.\n\n\nIf the intrinsic value is higher than the market price, the asset may be considered undervalued and potentially a good investment opportunity.\n\n\nAnalysts use valuation models to find out whether the asset is overvalued or undervalued and help the buyer get the best price possible.\n\n\n**Types of Valuation Models**\n-----------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Relative Valuation Model**\n\n\nIn relative valuation models, analysts compare the company\u2019s net worth with other companies of similar niches. It is assessed based on the ratios like earnings-per-share or price-to-earnings multiples.\u00a0\n\n\nEarning-per-share (EPS) is calculated based on the number of earnings of shareholders of shares divided by the number of outstanding shares in a market. In contrast, price-to-earning is assessed by market value per share divided by the earning-per-share.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Absolute Valuation Model**\n\n\nIn absolute valuation models, analysts try to find the true or intrinsic value of a company following market fundamentals. It means looking at the company\u2019s cash flow, dividends payment and growth graph. This model does not require any comparison with other companies. Further, it follows different types of absolute valuation models for a complete assessment. This includes discounted cash flow model, asset-based model, dividend discount model, etc.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen compared, assessment of a company\u2019s worth using the relative valuation model is easier than the absolute valuation model. For example, if the price-to-earning of a company is less as compared to that of other companies, a former company\u2019s shares appear to be undervalued.\u00a0\n\n\n**What are the Types of Valuation Methods?**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Comparable Method**\n\n\nIn this method, analysts compare a company\u2019s metrics with other companies of similar industry and size. It considers the past transactions of similar companies to estimate appropriate value. For example, in asset-based valuation methods, analysts add all market value of assets, to get the intrinsic value of a company and compare the same with other businesses.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, depending on a company\u2019s niche and mode of operation, different models are suitable for different companies. For instance, it is inappropriate to use an asset-based model for a company that has not acquired sufficient assets. For them, it is more feasible to follow an earning-based approach.\n\n\n* ### **Precedent Transaction Method**\n\n\nThe precedent transaction method is a process where analysts assess a company against other similar companies sold recently. Generally, this valuation method is necessary during a merger or acquisition with another company.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Discounted Cash Flow Method**\n\n\nIn this process, analysts determine investment or asset value based on cash inflows and outflows generated by these factors. While calculating, these cash flows are discounted with a rate based on their current value. It indicates an assumption of interest rates or rates of return made by investors.\u00a0\n\n\nLet\u2019s understand it with an example. When a company purchases machinery or plants for its new factory, there will be a cash outflow. Now this cash outflow will be assessed by the cash inflow generated by this asset. These cash flows are discounted to the current value to determine the net present value of a business.\u00a0\n\n\n**Example of Valuation**\n------------------------\n\n\nOne way a company\u2019s valuation is calculated is the market capitalisation, or its market cap. A company\u2019s market cap is calculated by multiplying each share price with the total number of shares outstanding in a market.\n\n\nFor instance, if the value of a company share is Rs. 50, and there are 1,00,000 shares outstanding in the open market, then its market capitalisation is Rs. 50,00,000.\u00a0\n\n\n**Effect of Earnings on Valuation**\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nEPS acts as a profit indicator. It means the greater the value of earnings from shares, the more valuable will be the company\u2019s shares. In addition to this, analysts also use price-to-earning (P/E) for stock valuation. This ratio determines the level of the stock price concerning the earnings generated by each share.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that valuation methods can vary depending on a company\u2019s industry, stage of development, and specific circumstances. Valuing a company is a complex task that often requires a combination of quantitative analysis, qualitative factors, and market conditions.\u00a0\n\n\n**What is the Purpose of Valuation?**\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nThe general purpose of a valuation is to calculate the worth of a company. This approach allows buyers to understand a company\u2019s prospects and how much worth is an asset in comparison to its current market price. Thus, sellers can estimate the selling price of the assets.\u00a0\n\n\nValuation is pivotal when there is a scenario of merger and acquisition or in case of winding up. In addition to this, a company may undergo a valuation during capital financing or security investment.\u00a0\n\n\n**Contribution of RazorpayX to Seamless Corporate Operations**\n\n\nRazorpayX, a premium banking suite offers a myriad of features that makes modern-day banking and book-keeping seamless and time-saving.

As this investment increases the net present value of a company, hence the process is important for future profitability and adding value to a business. \n\n\n\n\n\n### What is the core advantage of a business valuation?\n\n\n\nValuation of a business offers a clear idea of where a business stands in terms of earning-per-share and other metrics. This approach also lets buyers know how much they will pay for an asset of a company. \n\n\n\n\n\n### How does market value affect the balance sheet?\n\n\n\nThe market value of assets affects the balance sheet profoundly and shows the liquidation of assets. Moreover, it helps to analyze the tax liability on liquidated assets that have an entry in the balance sheet. \n\n\n\n\n\n### What is a valuation of goodwill?\n\n\n\nAs goodwill is an intangible asset, the valuation of the same is based on assumptions mostly. It considers the reputation earned by a company and develops trust among its investors and clients. Some of the methods used to value goodwill are super-profit methods and average-profit methods.", "[June 13, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/types-of-working-capital/)\n\n6 Mins Read\n\n\nWorking capital is the liquidity available to a company to carry out its day-to-day expenses. Two fundamental elements of business affecting working capital are current assets and current liabilities. The short term financial position of a business can be determined by analysing these two metrics.\n\n\nThere are many types of working capital depending on its value and periodicity. It helps in allocating cash, inventories, and accounts receivable and payable better.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n* [What is Working Capital?](#What-is-Working-Capital \"What is Working Capital?\")\n* [Types of Working Capital](#Types-of-Working-Capital \"Types of Working Capital\")\n\t+ [Permanent Working Capital](#Permanent-Working-Capital \"Permanent Working Capital\u00a0\")\n\t+ [Variable Working Capital](#Variable-Working-Capital \"Variable Working Capital\")\n\t+ [Gross Working Capital](#Gross-Working-Capital \"Gross Working Capital\")\n\t+ [Net Working Capital](#Net-Working-Capital \"Net Working Capital\")\n\t+ [Negative Working Capital](#Negative-Working-Capital \"Negative Working Capital\")\n* [Factors Determining the Requirement of Working Capital](#Factors-Determining-the-Requirement-of-Working-Capital \"Factors Determining the Requirement of Working Capital\")\n* [Did you know?](#Did-you-know \"Did you know?\")\n* [FAQs](#FAQs \"FAQs\")\n\t+ [What are the three main components of working capital?](#What-are-the-three-main-components-of-working-capital \"What are the three main components of working capital?\")\n\t+ [What are the most important elements of working capital management?](#What-are-the-most-important-elements-of-working-capital-management \"What are the most important elements of working capital management?\")\n\t+ [What is the working capital ratio?](#What-is-the-working-capital-ratio \"What is the working capital ratio?\")\n\t+ [What is the ideal working capital ratio?](#What-is-the-ideal-working-capital-ratio \"What is the ideal working capital ratio?\")\n\n**What is Working Capital?**\n----------------------------\n\n\nWorking capital is the difference between the current assets and liabilities of a company. This difference projects how much capital is available to a company to meet its regular needs.\u00a0To calculate the working capital of a business, use this equation:\n\n\n**Working Capital = Current Assets \u2013 Current Liabilities**\n\n\n**Types of Working Capital**\n----------------------------\n\n\n### **Permanent Working Capital**\n\n\nIt is the minimum working capital a business requires to operate and cover all its liabilities. In other words, it is the least amount of current assets required to run a business. The amount of permanent working capital required depends on the growth of the business. If the business grows, it will have more liabilities. Thus, the business will need a much higher working capital.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis capital further divides into two types of working capital:\u00a0\n\n\n* **Regular Working Capital:** It includes the minimum capital required for a business to cover all its day-to-day business operations costs. Regular working capital includes salaries, wages, maintenance and overhead expenses. Businesses need to maintain regular working capital to ensure smooth and stable operations.\n* **Reserve Margin Working Capital:** Reserve Margin Working Capital is the amount of capital which companies reserve in addition to their regular working capital. Businesses uses it as emergency capital in case of unforeseen circumstances. The fund also acts as a contingency during unexpected market situations, opportunities or natural calamities.\n\n\n### **Variable Working Capital**\n\n\nVariable working capital or fluctuating working capital is one of the types of working capital that businesses use as a temporary period investment. The amount of such capital changes depending upon the growth and size of the business.\n\n\nThere are two types of working capital in terms of variables:\u00a0\n\n\n* **Seasonal Variable Working Capital:** Businesses often need some extra amount of working capital to carry out its operation. At these times they borrow funds or take loans to meet their working capital needs. It is mainly common for seasonal businesses.\n* **Special Variable Working Capital:** Businesses require special or supplementary working capital to undertake new operations or cope with unforeseen events. Thus, the special variable working capital is used for risk management, launching new products or financial marketing campaigns.\n\n\n### **Gross Working Capital**\n\n\nIt is the calculated total of a company\u2019s current assets. Gross working capital does not involve the deduction of the company\u2019s liabilities.\n\n\n### **Net Working Capital**\n\n\nNet working capital is one of the most critical types of working capital one can estimate by deducting net current assets from net current liabilities. Businesses that have enough net working capital, have an increased possibility to grow into something big. Other than that, companies having negative or insufficient net working capital have higher odds to declare bankruptcy.\u00a0\n\n\n### Negative Working Capital\n\n\nNegative working capital refers to a financial situation where a company\u2019s current liabilities exceed its current assets. In simpler terms, it means that a business has more short-term debts to pay off than the cash and assets readily available to cover those obligations.\n\n\nNegative working capital can also signal potential challenges in meeting financial obligations and may require careful monitoring and proactive measures to ensure long-term stability.\n\n\n**Factors Determining the Requirement of Working Capital**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n* **Type and Size of the Business**\n\n\nThe amount of working capital a business requires depends a lot on the size and nature of trade. For example, trading companies require a huge amount of working capital as it stocks huge quantities of goods. Whereas, the working capital requirement for a manufacturing company is much lesser.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Business Cycle**\n\n\nThe business cycle also has a huge impact on the working capital needs of a business. Seasonal businesses require additional working capital to expand the business during seasonal booms.\u00a0\n\n\nBusinesses also require working capital to meet the needs of increased sales. In such cases, they borrow money or take loans to fulfil the demand.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Production Cycle**\n\n\nThe production cycle or the operating cycle is the time it takes to produce the final product from raw materials.\u00a0 It has a huge impact on the working capital requirement of a company.\n\n\nFor example, businesses that have a longer production cycle need much more working capital to meet their operational needs. In other words, the increased production cycle is directly proportional to the need for the working capital of a company.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Operational Efficiency**\n\n\nThe operational efficiency of businesses depends on a lot of factors such as short production cycles, quick sales and shorter debt collection periods. Each business achieves this operational efficiency by managing its working capital.\n\n\nBusinesses that are operationally efficient need to invest less in working capital. Similarly, businesses that are not operationally efficient need to invest in working capital.\u00a0\n\n\n**Contribution of RazorpayX to the Growth of Small Businesses**\n\n\n[RazorpayX](https://razorpay.com/x/) helps companies upscale their operations by supercharging their whole financial process.

This withdrawal of money can be for any purpose. It does not require holders to submit any withdrawal application to the financial institute. Thus, demand deposit accounts offer money to tackle day-to-day expenses and also pay minimal interest on account of the funds deposited in these accounts.\u00a0\n\n\n**How Does Demand Deposit Account Work?**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nMaintaining a demand deposit account is hassle-free for small business owners as it intends to provide ready money. DDA holders don\u2019t need to notify their financial institution before withdrawing from the account. Since the funds from this account are available \u201con demand\u201d, hence it is called a demand deposit.\n\n\nThe account holders of these accounts can withdraw cash from the nearest ATM or Automated Teller Machine. However, the amount of money to be withdrawn must be present in the account. Though there are no restrictions upon withdrawing funds, the bank or financial institutions may set a daily limit or maximum limit of withdrawal from these accounts.\u00a0\n\n\nIn this account, any amount of funds deposited by the account holder is called DDA credit. On the other hand, cash that is withdrawn from the account is called a DDA debit.\u00a0\n\n\n**Types of Demand Deposit Accounts**\n------------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Checking Accounts**\n\n\n[Checking accounts](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/checking-account/) are types of demand deposit accounts that have higher liquidity. This means anyone can withdraw funds from these accounts at any time during need. However, these accounts offer very low rates of interest or sometimes no interest at all.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Savings Accounts**\n\n\nSavings accounts are the most common types of demand deposit accounts that holders use for a long duration. Generally, to keep a savings account, one needs to maintain a minimum balance in those accounts. Under the evolved banking system, every adult can open a savings account. In addition, these account savings offer more interest when the holder deposits a larger amount.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Money Market Accounts**\n\n\nAccount holders who follow the market interests, open this type of demand deposit account. The interest rates of these market accounts fluctuate according to the economic situations and activities of the Reserve Bank of India. Hence, the interest rates fluctuate daily and it is difficult to assess whether it is higher than the savings account.\u00a0\n\n\n**Special Considerations**\n--------------------------\n\n\n* DDAs can have more than one owner or joint owners. Though the signature of both is necessary while opening the account, one owner can do the closing. Furthermore, both of the owners can sign a check, deposit cash or withdraw money from the account without the permission of the other.\n* Check if there is a minimum balance to maintain or open a demand deposit account. Whenever the account holder fails to maintain that minimum balance in the account, he or she may be subject to a fee charged by the bank for a low balance.\n* Upon opening a DDA, holders can withdraw cash on-demand with no eligibility requirements. In addition, these accounts have no lock-up period and endless transfer options. Also, one can withdraw unless that specific amount is present in the account.\n\n\n**Benefits of Opening a Demand Deposit Account**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n* **Liquidity**\n\n\nOne of the pivotal benefits of demand deposit accounts is how convenient it is to withdraw cash from these accounts. Account holders can, without any limitation, deposit and withdraw funds from a DDA to meet their daily expenses and payment of bills.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Zero Penalty or Fees**\n\n\nGenerally, withdrawal of money from demand deposit accounts requires no fees or charges, made by the bank or financial institutions. Hence, account holders can take out funds during emergencies or meet day-to-day transactions without any hassles.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Safety Deposits**\n\n\nMostly, demand deposit accounts have insurance and follow security standards by the bank or financial institutions. Hence if the financial institutions fail to operate, it will safeguard a certain amount of deposits per individual account holder.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n* **Myriad of Features**\n\n\nDemand deposit accounts are extremely flexible and easy to access to manage daily expenses.

The account holder of these DDAs does not need to provide advance notice to the bank or financial institutions before withdrawing any amount.\u00a0\n\n\n**Demand Deposits vs Term Deposits**\n------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Basis of Difference** | **Term Deposit Accounts** | **Demand Deposit Accounts** |\n| **Level of liquidity** | In term deposits, also called time deposits, the account holders have restrictions in withdrawing money for a predefined time frame.\u00a0 | In the case of DDAs, account holders can access the account to withdraw funds at any time. |\n| **Accessibility** | Money deposited in the term deposit accounts can be accessed to meet daily expenses.

There are various outcomes to this process, such as inflation in earnings per head (positive), reduction in the number of shares outstanding in the market, etc.\n\n\nThe shares which are repurchased are cancelled from stock lists and are redistributed in the future. Hence, this process of buyback creates a supply crunch of shares which immediately increases its demand. Moreover, this boost in demand increases the prices of these shares, adding value for shareholders.\u00a0\n\n\n**Process of Buyback or Share Repurchase**\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Method 1:** In this case, a company may initiate a buyback from an open market. They can do so through a secondary market by contacting their brokers to buy back a large number of shares over a specific period.\n\n\n**Method 2:** In other cases, a company opting to buy back some portion of outstanding shares, may issue a tender offer. This tender offer specifies a bid to purchase shares from shareholders and is made public to create awareness. In addition, this offer specifies that share prices and a timeframe open for this buyback program.\u00a0\n\n\nThe company proceeds with buyback at a fixed price which is over and above the prevailing market value. The effect of this scheme speeds up the contraction of outstanding shares floating in an open market.\u00a0\n\n\n**Example of Share Buyback**\n----------------------------\n\n\nLet\u2019s consider that a company has 50 lakhs shares outstanding in the stock market and Rs.50 crore as cash. The market value per share is Rs 10. At the beginning of the financial year, a company decides to buy back 10 lakhs shares using Rs 1 crore cash from an open stock market. Now, this company has Rs 49 crores as cash-in-hand and 40 lakhs shares outstanding in the share market.\u00a0\n\n\nHence, through this buyback program, a company reinvest in itself using a portion of its excess cash.\u00a0\n\n\n**Reasons For Share Buyback**\n-----------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Increase in Share Prices**\n\n\nOne of the pivotal reasons company owners initiate a buyback program is to increase the price of its share in an open market. Sometimes, a company may consider share prices to be undervalued in comparison to competitors. Hence, a company would repurchase some outstanding shares from an open market to decrease the supply of the same.\u00a0\n\n\nEventually, the demand for these shares will increase, accelerating the per unit price of shares. Furthermore, this will establish a profitable condition for the company.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Surge in Shareholder Value**\n\n\nEarning-per-share (EPS) indicates a company\u2019s level of earning profits concerning the outstanding shares of common stocks. To calculate EPS one needs to divide the company\u2019s profits by the total number of outstanding common shares. In case it\u2019s low, companies initiate a buyback program periodically. It decreases the level of these outstanding shares in an open market.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHence, the shortage of supply and the high-on-demand situation of these shares increases the EPS margin. This further creates a value addition to the existing shareholders of the company. Due to this effect, existing shareholders now possess greater stakes and hold shares that are higher in unit prices.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Tax Effectiveness & Benefits**\n\n\nThe buyback of shares using excess cash-in-hand is a better tax-effective option than initiating dividend payments. Dividend payments attract high tax under the corporate tax regime and companies can avoid it through repurchase. In fact, it is taxed at three different levels.\n\n\nStock buybacks, on the other hand, only attract DDT and this amount gets deducted before shareholders get the surrendered earnings.\n\n\n* ### **Better Utilisation of Excess Cash-in-Hand**\n\n\nGenerally, companies use excess money to buy back shares. This lets existing investors know that there isn\u2019t any shortage of cash inflows to tackle any emergencies. In addition to this, keeping large liquid cash in banks does not offer benefits in the long run. Also, initiating a buyback program rather than reinvesting in alternative assets like private equity, tangible assets, etc., showcases the healthy financial status of a company.\u00a0\n\n\nThus, medium and large-sized businesses often opt for this practice to increase the value of the remaining stocks and surge the profit margin in the long run.\u00a0\n\n\n**The Bottom Line**\n\n\nWhile share buybacks are important for businesses\u2019 good financial management, another important factor is the banking platform that businesses use.\n\n\nOne-stop banking solutions platforms like [RazorpayX](https://razorpay.com/x/current-accounts/) allow business owners to open [current accounts](https://razorpay.com/x/current-accounts/?utm_source=direct&utm_medium=website), [pay taxes](https://razorpay.com/x/tax-payments/), schedule payments, [pay vendors](https://razorpay.com/x/vendor-payments/) seamlessly and check invoices from a single dashboard \u2013 saving valuable time and effort.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is the difference between buyback and redemption of shares?\n\n\n\nIn the case of a share buyback, a company purchases back the shares from shareholders at a price higher than the market value. On the other hand, during the redemption of shares, a company asks shareholders to sell a part of their shareholdings back to the company. The company sets a call price for all these redeemable shares which is set during the issuance of shares. \n\n\n\n\n\n### What is the direct effect of the share buyback on a financial statement of a business?\n\n\n\nShare buyback directly impacts the financial statements of a business as well as the income statement of the company. The cash companies use to repurchase stocks record it in the business's earnings reports and under the cash flow statement as financial activities. It influences a decrease in the company\u2019s cash holdings and total assets. \n\n\n\n\n\n### How will you compare dividends and share buyback?\n\n\n\nOne of the basic differences between dividends and share buyback is that every existing shareholder of a company receives a dividend. Whereas, during share repurchase, shareholders who want to participate in the following are only invited. \n\n\n\n\n\n### How do share buybacks affect investors?\n\n\n\nWhen a company calls for a buyback of its shares, it eventually increases the earning per share of outstanding shares in this market. Hence, this puts existing investors or shareholders in a much more beneficial position with their increased stake in a company.", "[June 12, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/business/)\n\n7 Mins Read\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n* [What is a Business?](#What-is-a-Business \"What is a Business?\")\n* [How Does a Business Work?](#How-Does-a-Business-Work \"How Does a Business Work?\")\n* [Types of Businesses](#Types-of-Businesses \"Types of Businesses\")\n\t+ [Sole Proprietorship](#Sole-Proprietorship \"Sole Proprietorship\")\n\t+ [Partnership](#Partnership \"Partnership\")\n\t+ [Private Company](#Private-Company \"Private Company\u00a0\")\n\t+ [Public Company](#Public-Company \"Public Company\")\n* [Sizes of Business](#Sizes-of-Business \"Sizes of Business\")\n\t+ [Small Businesses](#Small-Businesses \"Small Businesses\")\n\t+ [Medium Sized Businesses](#Medium-Sized-Businesses \"Medium Sized Businesses\")\n\t+ [Large Businesses](#Large-Businesses \"Large Businesses\")\n* [Examples of Businesses](#Examples-of-Businesses \"Examples of Businesses\")\n* [How to Start Your Own Business](#How-to-Start-Your-Own-Business \"How to Start Your Own Business\")\n\t+ [Online Business](#Online-Business \"Online Business\")\n* [Business Funding and Finances](#Business-Funding-and-Finances \"Business Funding and Finances\")\n* [FAQs](#FAQs \"FAQs\")\n\t+ [What is the definition of business?](#What-is-the-definition-of-business \"What is the definition of business?\")\n\t+ [How can I start my business?](#How-can-I-start-my-business \"How can I start my business?\")\n\t+ [What is profit in business?](#What-is-profit-in-business \"What is profit in business?\")\n\t+ [What are the types of business?](#What-are-the-types-of-business \"What are the types of business?\")\n\n**What is a Business?**\n-----------------------\n\n\nA business is a group of people that come together to engage in commercial activities to generate revenue and make a profit.\n\n\nBusinesses offer products or services to customers in exchange for payment. Depending on the ownership and size of the business, we generally categorize businesses into sole proprietorship, partnership and registered company.\u00a0\n\n\n**How Does a Business Work?**\n-----------------------------\n\n\nAll businesses start as an [idea](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/small-business-ideas/). An innovative entrepreneur comes up with an idea, that she can scale up into a money-making trade. The very first step to establishing a business is to create a [business plan](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/business-plan/).\u00a0\n\n\nA business plan is a document that outlines the goals, strategies, funding sources and all the details that go into starting and running a business.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce this detailed business plan is ready, the founder approaches investors, banks or her own funds to finance the business. This money invested into the founding of the business is called [capital](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/capital-financing/).\u00a0\n\n\nThe main objective of any business is to make a profit. In the early years of business, the bottom-line number is usually in the negative, but with the right planning, budgeting and management, businesses eventually become and remain profitable.\u00a0\n\n\n**Types of Businesses**\n-----------------------\n\n\nDepending on the ownership structure, there are three types of businesses.\u00a0\n\n\n### [*Sole Proprietorship*](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/all-about-sole-proprietorships/)\n\n\nA sole proprietorship is a business that is owned and managed by a single individual. This person is responsible for all the tax and legal liabilities of the business. This means that if the business goes bankrupt, the founder will have to pay off debts from personal assets.\u00a0\n\n\nOn the other hand, the founder enjoys all profits from the business without having to share or divide amongst other shareholders.\u00a0\n\n\n### *Partnership*\n\n\nA partnership is a business that is founded and managed by two or more people, who work together as partners. They share resources, responsibilities, as well as any profits or losses that the business brings in.\u00a0\n\n\nThe division of stakes between partners can be equal \u2013 a 50:50 split, or a 25:25:25:25 split. It can also be an unequal split \u2013 60:40 or 30:70.\u00a0\n\n\n### *Private Company*\n\n\nA private company is one which is owned by a group of individuals, who own shares in the company and bear its losses or receive any profits as per their stake in the company. These shareholders are usually the founder\u2019s friends and family, or private investors.\u00a0\n\n\nUnlike a sole proprietorship or partnership, the owners of a private company do not always manage the operations of the business. Privately traded companies are not required to disclose their financial information to the public.\u00a0\n\n\n### *Public Company*\n\n\nA public company is a business that is owned and funded by the public. Shares are offered to the public in an [Initial Public Offering (IPO)](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/ipo-all-about-initial-public-offering/). Members of the public can buy or sell shares of this company on the stock market, and will then have to bear the company\u2019s losses or profits.\u00a0\n\n\nPublic companies are required to disclose their financial information, statements and all important details to the public. They are tightly regulated by government agencies like India\u2019s SEBI or the U.S. SEC.\n\n\n**Sizes of Business**\n---------------------\n\n\nDepending on the amount of capital invested, the revenue generated and the number of employees, we classify businesses into three sizes.\u00a0\n\n\n### *Small Businesses*\n\n\nBusinesses with a turnover of less than Rs 5 crores, and capital investment of less than around Rs 25 lakhs come under the [MSME](https://msme.gov.in/) (Micro and Small Enterprises) category.\u00a0\n\n\nIn India, there are thousands and thousands of MSMEs \u2013 restaurants, grocery stores, mechanic shops and more. They are usually owned and operated by one or two individuals, or a family, and employ limited staff.\u00a0\n\n\n### *Medium Sized Businesses*\n\n\nThese businesses are bigger \u2013 they bring in much more profit and require more operating capital than MSMEs. They also employ a much bigger staff of around 100-1000 people and might operate in multiple locations.\u00a0\n\n\nEnterprises with turnover between Rs 75 crores and Rs 250 crores can be called medium-sized business. Capital investment by medium-sized businesses is usually between Rs 2 crores and Rs 5 crores.\u00a0\n\n\n### *Large Businesses*\n\n\nThe biggest kinds of businesses operate as companies across several states or even countries. They employ a staff of more than 1000+ people and bring in turnover of more than Rs 250 crores. These businesses are usually publicly or privately owned companies and are regulated by government agencies.\u00a0\n\n\nThese businesses also follow a hierarchical structure within the employees and are organized by departments \u2013 the HR department, finance department or sales department.\u00a0\n\n\n**Examples of Businesses**\n--------------------------\n\n\n**Tata Group**\n\n\nThe Tata Group is one of India\u2019s largest and most diversified conglomerates.

Your bank website promised that the information is \u201cjust a click away\u201d. You visit your bank\u2019s website optimistically, only to realize there is so much information scattered all across the computer screen that leaves you clueless about where that \u201cmagical one click\u201d is.\n\n\n![chatbot](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/06/chatbot_img-1024x916.png)Admit it, that we have all come across such scenarios. Be it travel and ticketing, banking, or e-commerce portals, we have all landed on websites that have too much information, leaving us more confused about where to find what we are looking for.\n\n\nA research paper published by Chao Liu and colleagues from the Microsoft Research team suggests that the average user spends between 10 and 20 seconds on a webpage to find information. Any number above that probably means that the website offers a near-excellent value proposition.\n\n\nSo, how do we deliver a \u2018wow experience\u2019 to users who spend as little as 10 seconds on our website? While a lot of this is to be addressed by the design, colour themes, and layout of the website, there are also other areas that can be looked at. So, is there really a way we can answer our user\u2019s questions, and provide the information that they came looking for in \u2018just-a-click\u2019?\n\n\nYes, with a Chatbot.\n\n\nWhat is a Chatbot?\n------------------\n\n\nChatbots are computer programs designed to simulate human conversation. They use artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner.\n\n\nThe use of chatbots has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many companies using them as a means of interacting with customers and providing 24/7 support. In this article, we will discuss the history, types, benefits, and limitations of chatbots.\n\n\nIs this a recent phenomenon?\n----------------------------\n\n\nChatbots have been around for over half a century. The first chatbot, called ELIZA, was created by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966. ELIZA was designed to simulate a psychotherapist and was capable of engaging in a basic conversation with users. Since then, chatbots have evolved significantly, and today they are capable of providing a wide range of services, including customer support, sales, and even personal assistance.\n\n\nHow do they work?\n-----------------\n\n\nThere are two main types of chatbots: rule-based and AI-based. Rule-based chatbots are programmed to respond to specific keywords or phrases. For example, a rule-based chatbot for a pizza restaurant may be programmed to respond to queries about menu items, prices, and delivery times. Rule-based chatbots are limited in their capabilities and can only respond to predetermined inputs.\n\n\nAI-based chatbots, on the other hand, use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner. These chatbots are trained using machine learning algorithms and can learn from past interactions with users to improve their responses over time. AI-based chatbots are much more sophisticated than rule-based chatbots and are capable of providing a wide range of services.\n\n\nHow can they benefit my organisation?\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nThere are several benefits of using chatbots, including:\n\n\n1. Improved customer service: Chatbots can provide 24/7 support, allowing customers to get the assistance they need at any time.\n2. Increased efficiency: Chatbots can handle multiple customer queries at once, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex tasks.\n3. Cost-effective: Chatbots can be more cost-effective than human agents, as they can handle a large volume of queries without requiring additional staff.\n4. Personalisation: AI-based chatbots can learn from past interactions with customers and provide personalized recommendations and solutions.\n5. Scalability: Chatbots can handle an unlimited number of users simultaneously, making them an ideal solution for businesses with a large customer base.\n\n\nOh! Is this a one-time investment that requires no maintenance?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo, not really! While chatbots have many benefits, they also have some limitations.\n\n\nFirst of all, they have limited capabilities. Particularly true with rule-based chatbots that can only respond to predetermined inputs, and is almost useless when queried on any term that is not a part of its database. AI-based chatbots, although a little more engaging than rule-based chatbots, can only respond to queries they have been trained on.\n\n\nChatbots are also incapable of handling complex queries. Chatbots may struggle with complex queries that require human-level reasoning and problem-solving skills.\n\n\nOne major drawback is that chatbots lack human emotions and may struggle to provide the same level of empathy and understanding as human agents would. Chatbots definitely require periodic maintenance and training to ensure they are providing accurate and up-to-date information to users. Chatbots collect and store user data, which may raise privacy concerns for some users.\n\n\nWho can use chatbots?\n---------------------\n\n\nChatbots can be used in a wide range of applications, including:\n\n\n**Customer support**: Chatbots can provide 24/7 support to customers, answering common queries and providing solutions to common problems.\n\n\n**Sales**: Chatbots can be used to guide customers through the sales process, providing product recommendations and answering questions about products.\n\n\n**Personal assistance**: Chatbots can be used as personal assistants, helping users with tasks such as scheduling appointments and setting reminders.\n\n\n**Education**: Chatbots can serve as a huge repository of information for students and teachers, alike.\n\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\n\n\u2018Customer Satisfaction\u2019 is history. In the present day, organisations are striving for what is called \u2018Customer Delight\u2019. Gone are those days when users would patiently (or impatiently!) wait for a \u2018Support Agent\u2019 to join the chat or call to have their issues resolved. Such lax now will hurt your customer base. Why not use AI to our advantage here? According to a paper published by IBM about chatbots, chatbots can be used to answer more than 80% of a user\u2019s routine questions, cutting customer service costs by more than 30%. This also means that a customer whose query has been satisfactorily answered is more likely to give a positive review. No surprise then \u2013 a research has indicated that websites with an integrated chatbot have scored an average of 82% satisfaction rate, as per the latest B2B chatbot stats.\n\n\nWith so much data available about its effectiveness, no wonder companies are investing in chatbots to up their game. From real estate to furniture recommendations, chatbots are being used to answer common customer queries easily.\n\n\nWe, at Razorpay have realised the potential and now, there is a dedicated team working to put this together.

User research is critical to ensure your documentation is sharp, accurate, consistent and delivers what the users look for.\u00a0\n\n\nA document has several elements:\u00a0\n\n\n* Design \u2013 Format, font type, size and colour, content layout and overall presentation\n* Content \u2013 Content structure, language, content quality, accuracy and simplicity\n* UX \u2013 Overall user experience, which means navigation, search, interactivity and feedback mechanism\n\n\nEach element is equally important and should be carefully considered with users in mind. Just imagine writing a 40-page guide which your users are unwilling to read, or designing a beautiful documentation website which is difficult to search or navigate! In both cases, they fail to meet the customers\u2019 expectations.\n\n\nConsider the case of the 40-page-long guide. You can get answers to your questions with user research. Why are the users unwilling to read the guide?\n\n\n* Is it too long?\n* Is it easy to search for information?\n* Is it easy to understand?\n* Does it contain enough examples and illustrations that make it engaging?\n* Is the document design boring?\n\n\n**Different methods of user research**\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nThere are different ways of doing User Research, such as User Interviews, Feedback Forms, Surveys and Focus Group Discussions, to name a few.\n\n\nThe method you should select to do user research depends on several factors:\n\n\n* How fast you want to do these\n* The type of inputs you want (qualitative or quantitative)\n* How much you are willing to invest\n* The stage at which you are doing user research\u00a0\n\t+ Beginning of a project to understand your users before you start authoring\n\t+ While writing a document to validate a few assumptions\n\t+ After a new/updated document is rolled out to understand consumption and feedback\n\n\nFeedback Forms and Surveys may be used for quick inputs from the users. It is faster, easier, inexpensive and can reach a larger audience.\n\n\nFocus Group Discussions and User Interviews, on the other hand, are time-consuming, expensive and exhausting. Shortlisting users, inviting them, following up, talking to them and recording the conversations \u2013 all require intense involvement. But, if executed well, these can bring fruitful results.\u00a0\n\n\n**More about user interviews**\n------------------------------\n\n\nUser Interviews are an excellent way to understand the users\u2019 needs, wants, and behaviour. User interviews, by definition, are conducting interviews with your users and asking them questions to understand better the user persona and what they want from your offering.\u00a0\n\n\n### **Conducting user interviews**\n\n\nDuring user interviews, you may ask your users a series of questions or ask them to perform a specific action using your product or service. What you choose depends on what stage of product development you are in. If a product demo or beta version is available, ask the users to perform a particular action using your product to learn how they use it, how easy the interface is, and user actions and behaviour. This can bring in valuable insights and help in finetuning the product. The same holds if you are doing user interviews to evaluate the usefulness of a document.\n\n\nFor example, when you do user interviews before documenting a product or service, understand when the users may read your document, how they would navigate it, and what kind of information they will look for. Based on these critical data points, you will be better placed and more confident when you structure the content and its layout, design and place some aspects in your document \u2013 CTAs, hyperlinks, callouts, etc.\n\n\n### **Steps involved in a user interview**\n\n\nI. Come up with a complete plan for conducting the user interview\n\n\n* + How many users\n\t+ Who will conduct the interview\n\t+ The process of connecting, shortlisting and interviewing users\n\t+ Interview framework and infrastructure \u2013 What questions to ask, test credentials and samples needed during the interview\n\t+ Budget for goodies, free samples or rewards for the participant\n\n\nII.

If we want to build the best [documentation](https://razorpay.com/docs/#home-payments) for our users, users should participate in the process.\u00a0\n\n\nWe started conducting these user interviews sometime in August 2022. The process was new, and we were experimenting with many new things. The biggest challenge we had was to find users, users who were the right fit and willing to participate. Follow-ups, reschedules, and last-minute drop-outs were difficult challenges. But, the learnings we had with each such interview were worth the pain!\n\n\nBy the close of FY 22-23, we had conducted 100 user interviews. We have now made user interviews a regular process that the Technical Writing team conducts \u2013 from finding, screening and interviewing users to recording findings.\u00a0\n\n\nThese interviews are not only used by the **Technical Writing team for improving documentation** but also by the **Solutions and Integrations team to understand the integration experience and gaps**, **Product Managers to understand the product and feature usability**, **Product Designers to understand the user journey** and how the product design can be further polished.\n\n\n**Our Learnings**\n-----------------\n\n\nBy overcoming each hurdle, we learnt a few basics. And if these basics are set right, the user interviews can never go wrong and bring significant value.\n\n\n**Screen the right candidates**\n\n\nThe users should be from your target audience, and the correct fitment should be evaluated before inviting them.\n\n\n**Do your homework well**\n\n\n1. Read the user profile (name, where they work and anything significant about the user)\n2. Frame your questions, the flow, what actions to perform, the interview setup and the infrastructure.\n3. Follow a template to initiate the conversation. Ask follow-up questions to validate your findings and to conclude the interview. Be natural and empathetic towards the participant.\n4. Guide the user if they are getting lost when asked to perform an action during the interview.\n\n\n**Ask open-ended questions**\n\n\nAsk questions that allow your user to do most of the talking. The more they talk, the better you understand the user.\n\n\n**Record**\n\n\nRecord the conversations and document your findings. These user interviews may be referred to in the future too by different groups and teams. You may also want to listen to your users repeatedly to validate certain assumptions. These recorded conversations can also be used in training.\n\n\n**Avoid bias and let the user express what they feel**\n\n\nThis is the toughest one. We all have certain biases and preferences for some colours and designs. It is not about you but the user!\n\n\n**Finishing Up**\n----------------\n\n\nWe agree that conducting user interviews is a cumbersome task. But, if planned well and executed diligently, the findings from these interviews can be used by multiple teams and bring in 3X benefits.

It helps stakeholders understand the market worth of a business.\u00a0\n\n\nThe value of a business is calculated before a merger, expansion or any major business event. There are many techniques to calculate the value of a company to ascertain the value of the business. This evaluation is used to analyze parameters like the business\u2019s future earnings prospects, capital structure, company management, etc.\n\n\n**Basics of Company Valuation**\n-------------------------------\n\n\nSome common approaches that businesses consider when valuing the business are discounting cash flow models, scrutinising financial statements, comparing with other companies with similar working patterns etc. Business owners generally seek the help of a professional business evaluator to get an objective evaluation of the business\u2019s worth.\u00a0\n\n\nCompany valuation plays a major role in tax reporting as well. As per the IRS (Internal Revenue Service), the business valuation must be on the basis of fair market value. Further, business operations like sales, purchasing shares of a company, etc., fall under taxation based on valuation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Different Methods of Company Valuation**\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n**1. Times Revenue Method**\n\n\nThe Times Revenue Method is a simplified approach used to estimate the value of a company based on its annual revenue. It is commonly used by small businesses, startups, or companies with limited historical data or earnings. The method involves multiplying the company\u2019s revenue by a predetermined multiple to arrive at its estimated value.\n\n\nThis method is often used as a starting point or in conjunction with other valuation methods to arrive at a more accurate estimate since this is a highly simplified method of valuation.\n\n\n\n**2. Earnings Multiplier**\n\n\nThe earnings multiplier method is a more accurate way of calculating a company\u2019s value. This is because considering a company\u2019s profit is a more reliable indicator of a company\u2019s success than revenue.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis method compares the company\u2019s earnings to the market value of its shares and calculates a multiple that is then applied to its earnings to estimate its value.\n\n\nThe multiple is typically derived from the valuation of similar companies in the market or industry. For example, if comparable companies are trading at an average P/E ratio of 15, you might choose to apply a similar multiple to the subject company.\n\n\nThe formula used in this method:\n\n\nBusiness value = Earnings of a Business x Multiplier\n\n\n**3. DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) Method**\n\n\nDiscounted cash flow method is the most detailed way to analyse the value of a business and demands the most assumptions and estimates. This kind of business valuation is almost the same as the earnings multiplier method and is based on future cash flows projection. These are balanced to obtain a company\u2019s current market value.\u00a0\n\n\nThe main difference between the DCF Method and Earnings Multiplier method is that the DCF Method takes inflation into consideration for the calculations.\u00a0\n\n\n**4. Market Capitalisation**\n\n\nThis is perhaps the simplest means of carrying out company valuation. In this method, the computation of business valuation takes place by multiplying the share price of a company by its total number of shares. This method is also used to compute a company\u2019s size and industry shares. The formula of the market capitalization method is-\n\n\nValuation = Share Price x Total number of shares\n\n\nOutstanding Shares = Total Issued Stock (\u2013) Treasury Shares\n\n\nA shortcoming of this market capitalisation method is that it only takes into consideration equity valuation, while most business bodies rely on a mix of equity and debt.\u00a0\n\n\n**5. Book Value**\n\n\nIn this method, businesses calculate company valuation from the book value collected from the data available on a balance sheet. Book value is calculated by subtracting the company\u2019s liabilities from the asset and evaluating the equity of the shareholder. For this process, deduct the value of intangibles in order to value the tangible assets.\u00a0\n\n\n**Importance of Conducting Business Valuation**\n\n\n* **Strategic Planning**\n\n\nOne of the most important reasons why conducting business valuation is necessary is that it aids strategic planning. A business valuation helps recognise mispriced securities and understand which projects a business body must invest in. Business bodies must focus on investing in projects that will enhance the net present value. Any investment-related decision is based on mini-valuation and is dependent on value creation as well as future profitability.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Purchasing or Selling Business**\n\n\nEven this business valuation proves beneficial during selling and buying a business.\u00a0 It is to ensure that both sellers and buyers can take an informed decision while going ahead with buying and selling, thus making the move profitable.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Capital Financing**\n\n\nA business valuation helps business owners when they have to negotiate with financial institutions for funding. The documents stating the business\u2019s worth and its potential of generating cash flow help business owners establish credibility with equity investors and lenders.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **Investing in Securities**\n\n\nMaking an investment in any securities can prove counterproductive if a proper analysis of the market does not take place. A business valuation helps determine the intrinsic value of an investment.\u00a0\n\n\n**Contribution of RazorpayX Towards the Growth of Small Businesses**\n\n\nBusinesses can now upscale their operations by availing of a suite of financial services from [RazorpayX](https://razorpay.com/x/).

It is, in fact, an alternative method that is used to cover the limitation of the market capitalisation method. In this process, different capital structures like equity, cash, debt, etc., are used to determine company valuation.", "[June 1, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/the-pros-cons-of-a-business-line-of-credit/)\n\n8 Mins Read\n\n\nA business line of credit is a flexible financing option provided by financial institutions, such as banks or NBFCs, that allows businesses to access funds up to a predetermined credit limit. It functions similarly to a credit card, where businesses can borrow funds as needed and only pay interest on the amount borrowed. Here are some key features of a business line of credit:\n\n\n1. 1. Revolving credit: A business line of credit provides businesses with a revolving credit facility. It means that once a lender approves a certain credit limit, you can borrow and repay funds within that limit multiple times over the course of the credit line\u2019s duration.\n\t2. Flexibility in usage: Businesses can utilise the funds from a line of credit for various purposes, such as covering working capital needs, managing cash flow gaps, purchasing inventory, paying suppliers, or investing in growth opportunities. The funds can be accessed whenever the business requires them, as long as it remains within the credit limit.\n\t3. Variable interest: Interest is only charged on the amount of funds actually borrowed from the credit line, not the entire credit limit. The interest rate on a business line of credit can be variable or fixed, depending on the terms agreed upon with the lender.\n\t4. Repayment terms: Businesses are typically required to make minimum monthly payments on the borrowed funds. The repayment terms may vary, and businesses may have the flexibility to repay the entire outstanding balance or make partial payments based on their cash flow.\n\t5. Renewal and review: Business lines of credit may have a specified term, such as one or two years. At the end of the term, the credit line may need to be renewed or reviewed by the lender based on the business\u2019s creditworthiness and financial performance.\n\t6. Credit evaluation: Lenders evaluate the creditworthiness of the business before approving a line of credit. Factors considered may include the business\u2019s credit history, financial statements, cash flow, and collateral.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEarly-stage businesses, also known as startups or emerging companies, are typically newly established ventures that are in the early phases of their operations. These businesses are characterised by their limited operating history, smaller scale, and high potential for growth. Here are some key defining characteristics of early-stage businesses:\n\n\n* Formation: Early-stage businesses are newly formed companies, often founded by entrepreneurs or a small group of individuals with a novel business idea or innovation.\n* Limited operating history: These businesses have a short track record in terms of their operations, sales, and financial performance. They may still be in the process of refining their business model and market positioning.\n* High growth potential: Early-stage businesses are often focused on rapid growth and scaling their operations. They aim to capture market share, establish a strong presence, and gain a competitive edge.\n* Innovation and disruption: Many early-stage businesses are built around innovative products, services, or technologies. They aim to disrupt existing markets or create entirely new ones with their unique value proposition.\n* Funding and investment: Early-stage businesses typically require external funding to support their growth plans. They often seek investment from angel investors, venture capitalists, or participate in startup incubators and accelerators.\n* Market validation: Early-stage businesses are in the process of validating their market fit and value proposition. They seek to attract customers, gain traction, and refine their product or service based on market feedback.\n* Risk and uncertainty: Early-stage businesses face higher levels of risk and uncertainty compared to more established companies. They often encounter challenges such as limited resources, market volatility, and intense competition.\n\n\nIf you relate to some or all of the characteristics above, a business line of credit can act as a successful financial product to a growing company like yours! Let\u2019s delve deeper.\n\n\nPros of business line of credit\n-------------------------------\n\n\nEarly-stage businesses can benefit from using a business line of credit in several ways. Here are a few common use cases where a business line of credit can be advantageous for early-stage businesses:\n\n\n1. 1. 1. Managing cash flow gaps: Early-stage businesses often experience uneven cash flow, with periods of high expenses and limited incoming revenue. A business line of credit can help bridge those gaps by providing access to funds when needed. For example, if a business has outstanding invoices from clients but needs immediate funds to cover operational expenses, a business line of credit can be used to bridge the cash flow until the invoices are paid.\n\t\t2. Purchasing inventory: Many early-stage businesses operate in industries where maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial for sales and growth. However, purchasing inventory upfront can strain cash flow. A business line of credit can help finance inventory purchases, ensuring that the business has the necessary products to meet customer demand without compromising on working capital.\n\t\t3. Seizing growth opportunities: Early-stage businesses often encounter unexpected growth opportunities that require quick action. These opportunities could include bulk purchasing discounts, marketing campaigns, expansion into new markets, or the chance to acquire a competitor. Having a line of credit allows businesses to swiftly capitalise on these opportunities by accessing funds to fuel growth initiatives without delay.\n\t\t4. Covering operational expenses: During slow periods or when faced with unexpected expenses, early-stage businesses may struggle to meet their ongoing operational costs. A business line of credit can provide the necessary funds to cover rent, utilities, employee salaries, or other essential expenses, ensuring the business can continue operating smoothly.\n\t\t5. Investing in equipment or technology: Upgrading equipment or adopting new technologies can enhance operational efficiency and productivity for early-stage businesses. However, purchasing or leasing equipment outright can be costly. A business line of credit can facilitate the acquisition of equipment or technology, allowing businesses to modernise their operations and remain competitive without a significant upfront investment.\n\n\nCons of business line of credit\n-------------------------------\n\n\nWhile a business line of credit can provide numerous benefits to early-stage businesses, there are also some potential disadvantages that should be considered. Here are a few drawbacks of using a business line of credit for early-stage businesses:\n\n\n1. Interest costs: Borrowing funds through a business line of credit incurs interest charges. Early-stage businesses must carefully evaluate the interest rates and terms associated with the credit line. If not managed effectively, high interest costs can add financial strain and reduce profitability.\n2. Debt accumulation: Depending on how a business manages its line of credit, there is a risk of accumulating debt. Without careful financial planning and repayment strategies, businesses may find themselves in a cycle of borrowing, which can hinder long-term financial stability and hinder growth opportunities.\n3. Qualification challenges: Early-stage businesses may face difficulties in qualifying for a business line of credit due to their limited credit history, insufficient collateral, or inadequate financial documentation. Lenders typically assess the creditworthiness of a business, which can pose challenges for newer ventures without an established track record.\n4. Potential dependency: Over-reliance on a business line of credit can be risky for early-stage businesses. Dependence on borrowed funds may hinder a business\u2019s ability to develop alternative financing strategies or seek additional sources of capital. Relying solely on a line of credit may limit long-term financial sustainability and flexibility.\n5. Impact on credit score: Late payments or excessive borrowing can negatively impact creditworthiness, making it more challenging to secure future financing or negotiate favourable terms with lenders.\n6. Need for repayment: Businesses using a line of credit must make regular payments to repay the borrowed funds. If a business faces cash flow constraints or unexpected financial setbacks, meeting the repayment obligations may become challenging, potentially leading to financial strain and strained relationships with lenders.\n\n\nTo sum up\u2026\n----------\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while a business line of credit can offer benefits, early-stage businesses should carefully assess their financial capabilities and determine if the expected return on investment justifies the cost of borrowing. Responsible and strategic utilisation of a line of credit can help early-stage businesses overcome financial challenges and fuel their growth trajectory.\n\n\nDid you know?\n-------------\n\n\n[Razorpay Line of Credit](https://razorpay.com/blog/business-banking/introducing-razorpay-line-of-credit/) makes it convenient for your business to get instant access to an unsecured line of credit and manage your cash requirements at all times, especially when faced with an unexpected demand.\n\n\n[![Business line of credit by Razorpay](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-01-at-12.20.10-PM-1024x575.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_EuDYP2caM&ab_channel=Razorpay)\n\n\nHere are a few benefits you can enjoy with Razorpay Line of Credit:\n\n\n* Line set up in just 2 business days with 24\\*7 cash withdrawals\n* No collateral.

It involves optimizing inventory levels, minimizing costs, and ensuring timely availability to meet customer demand, ultimately maximizing profitability and customer satisfaction.\n\n\nWhy do you need inventory management?\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nProper inventory management is the fundamental building block to your company\u2019s longevity. When your inventory is properly organised, your entire supply-chain will be on the right track. Not having your inventory in place can lead to issues like mis-shipments, out of stocks, overstocks, etc.\u00a0\n\n\nHere are quick pointers as to why inventory management is so important:\n\n\n### **Avoid spoilage**\n\n\n If your business sells perishable products or the products that come with an expiry date, like food or makeup accessories, it is highly possible that it will spoil if you do not sell it in time. Solid inventory management helps you avoid unnecessary spoilage.\u00a0\n\n\n### **Avoid deadstock**\n\n\nDeadstock does not only refer to expired material but also the stocks that can no longer be sold because it could have gone out of style or out of the season\u2019s demand. By managing your inventory in a better way, you can avoid issues like these.\n\n\n### **Save on storage costs**\n\n\nOftentimes, warehousing brings in a variable cost. This means you have to pay on the basis of the weight or size of your products. A thorough study of your inventory report over time will help you understand what products are sold best and when and hence, you will save on spending excess on the storage houses.\n\n\n### **Improper stocks**\n\n\nUsually, out of stocks and overstocks occur when a company uses manual methods to place orders, without overseeing the state of their inventory. This certainly is not a good predictor for inventory forecasting and hence results in too much stock or too little stock.\u00a0\n\n\nAll of these mistakes will not only cost you money but also cost you wasted labour to load and unload in the beginning and then rectifying the mistakes later. Simply put, when you don\u2019t implement proper inventory management techniques and tools, your risk of human error mistakes keeps going up. Not just monetarily, this also makes a direct impact on your customers\u2019 experience. Poor inventory management techniques can cost you negative customer reviews and your loyalty might take a negative hit as well.\u00a0\n\n\nTop inventory management techniques for your business\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEach business must try to remove as much human error as possible. Regardless of whichever inventory management tool you are planning to use, listed below inventory management techniques will help you improve your inventory *(and cash flow too)*!\n\n\n### 1. Set par levels\n\n\nMake the process simpler by setting a \u2018par level\u2019 for each of your product. Par level refers to the minimum quantity of a particular product that must be on hand, all the time. Whenever your inventory stocks dip below a predetermined value, you know it\u2019s time to place an order.\n\n\nPar product value may differ from product to product and also by how quickly is an item sold or how long does it take to get it sold.\u00a0\n\n\nSetting up a par value will take some time initially- you will have to conduct research for each product based on the season and other factors but after setting it up ones, it will simplify the entire process of ordering!\n\n\nRemember to keep checking on your par values from time to time, to check if your assumption still makes sense or you need to tweak it a little.\n\n\n### 2. First-in first-out (FIFO)\n\n\nAs the name suggests, this principle means that the first stock that comes in goes out first. This is especially important for perishable products so that you don\u2019t end up with spoiled or expired products. It is also a good idea to practice FIFO for non-perishable products. The reason is, if boxes are kept in for long, they are likely to get worn-out. You certainly don\u2019t want to end up with something obsolete that you can\u2019t sell.\n\n\nIn order to have a proper FIFO in place, all you need is an organised warehouse. Typically, this means adding the product from the back and pushing the existing products to the front.\u00a0\n\n\n### 3. Build & manage relationships\n\n\nBuilding a strong and reliable network plays an important role in a healthy inventory. This inventory management technique goes a long way whether you need to return a slow-selling item or restock a fast seller quickly or trouble manufacturing issues or temporarily expand storage space. It is important to have a strong relationship with your suppliers. That way, they will be more cooperative with you and help you find solutions quickly.\u00a0\n\n\nPlease note, a good relationship is not just about being friendly. It is about clear, proactive and open conversations.\u00a0\n\n\n### 4. Regular auditing\n\n\nEven if you have a tool or software to manage your inventory, it is a good idea to make sure that the screen data matches the actual facts.\u00a0\n\n\nFind out ways to have a quick check on all of your products and if they are in sell-worthy condition.\n\n\n### 5. Using the ABC method\n\n\nOut of all your products, there are some products that need more attention than others. Using an ABC analysis lets you prioritize your inventory management by separating out the products that require a lot of attention from those that don\u2019t. You can do this by listing your products in one of the three categories:\n\n\n* High-value products with a low frequency of sales (Category A)\n* Moderate-value products with a moderate frequency of sales (Category B)\n* Low-value product with a high frequency of sales (Category C)\n\n\nYour Items in category A require regular attention since they have huge financial impact but the sales are unpredictable. The items you list in Category C require less attention since they have a smaller financial impact and they are constantly getting sold. The items you list in Category B fall somewhere in between.\n\n\n\n### 6. Accurate forecasting\n\n\nOne of the most important inventory management techniques is to have precise and reliable forecasting in place. Even though your prediction might not be 100 percent accurate, you will be prepared for something that might happen. Make accurate predictions by looking at the following:\n\n\n* Current market trends\n* Last year\u2019s sales during the current time\n* Current year\u2019s growth rate\n* Seasonality of your products\n* Overall economy\n\n\nBest inventory management tools\n-------------------------------\n\n\nNow that you know what is inventory management, why you need it and have a hold of best inventory management techniques, it\u2019s time you know about the best tools to help you get started. Here are the top inventory management tools to assist your business growth:\n\n\n* NetSuite ERP\n* Zoho Inventory\n* QuickBooks\n* Systum\n* SellerCloud\n\n\nWith the above mentioned powerful inventory management techniques in place, you can reduce additional costs while helping your business to stay profitable. You can also analyze sales patterns and predict future sales and get yourself and the business prepared for the unexpected.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s time you take control of your inventory management and stop losing money and for the same, we hope this article helps you throughout!", "[May 29, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/managing-finances/)\n\n7 Mins Read\n\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced world, making money is not nearly as important as managing finances.

You can choose to do this the traditional way, by recording your daily expenses in a journal or diary or by making use of the many expense management apps available online.\u00a0\n\n\n\nGenerally, we tend to underestimate how much money we spend on a day-to-day basis, and tracking all your expenses helps keep accurate track of how much money leaves your pocket.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can also choose to track your expenses on an Excel spreadsheet \u2013 there are plenty of templates and formats available on the internet to help.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Make and Maintain a Budget**\n\n\nA budget is when you allocate funds to your different expenditures, usually on a monthly basis. You can choose to distribute your money across expenses based on your priority \u2013 food, utilities, rent, entertainment, and more.\u00a0\n\n\nMake sure you set realistic goals in your budget. The best way to identify a realistic fund allocation is to follow the first tip and track your expenses for a month or two \u2013 this will help you identify how much money you typically spend on various expenses, and optimize accordingly.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Set Concrete Goals**\n\n\nBefore you think about managing finances, make sure you know what you are saving for. It could be any goal for any point in the future \u2013 education, a house, a vehicle, an emergency fund. You will need to also determine whether this is a long-term, medium-term or short-term goal.\n\n\nIt is important to know this because your financial management strategy will change based on the duration and type of goal.\u00a0\n\n\nIf your goal is more long-term, like a retirement fund, your short-term expense-cutting efforts need not be very intensive. You can also choose to invest in high-risk instruments like equities or options because the risk factor is much less over the long term.\u00a0\n\n\nIf your goal is short or medium-term, you will need to be much more careful with your expense management and investments.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Never Too Late to Invest**\n\n\nLearn about different investment options, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or real estate. Consider your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals when choosing investment vehicles. If you\u2019re new to investing, consult with a financial advisor for guidance.\n\n\nInvesting money in the right kinds of financial instruments can be a valuable source of passive income. Remember to do plenty of research and reading before investing, since some financial instruments are subject to market risk, which means you can incur significant losses if you are not careful!\n\n\n\n* **Avoid Debt**\n\n\nTry and avoid taking out loans as much as possible \u2013 being in debt only sets you back, with interest payments and the possible risk of default. Of course, there might come circumstances when you absolutely have to take out a loan.\u00a0\n\n\nIn this situation, prioritize repaying your loans above all else. Start with high-interest debts, such as credit card balances, to minimize interest costs. Consider debt consolidation or negotiation to streamline payments and potentially lower interest rates.\n\n\n* **Automate Your Savings**\n\n\nToday, most banks offer automated RDs and FDs \u2013 which automatically deduct a pre-decided amount from your bank account every month. This balance is put into a deposit account which earns a minimal but assured interest.\u00a0\n\n\nAutomating savings helps reduce the burden of having to remember to save money every month. You can also opt-in for long-term savings options that deduct directly from your salary, like a VPF, or a pension fund.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Reduce Unnecessary Expenses**\n\n\nReview your expenses regularly and identify areas where you can cut back. Reduce discretionary spending, negotiate bills, and look for cost-saving opportunities like switching to a more affordable service provider.\u00a0\n\n\nOne good way to cut unnecessary expenses is to make a \u201cWants vs Needs\u201d list. Prioritize essential items while cutting back on non-essential ones, and ask yourself if a purchase aligns with your financial goals before making it.\n\n\nOther ways you can reduce unnecessary expenses for better managing finances:\n\n\nCook at home more! Eating out and ordering in may not seem immediately expensive, but the costs add up over time.\u00a0\n\n\nMinimize transportation costs \u2013 opt for public transport or carpooling with friends over expensive cabs or autos. Owning a vehicle can also be quite expensive, with insurance payments and the rising cost of fuel. Public transport is also a very environmentally friendly option.\u00a0\n\n\nDIY skills \u2013 learn basic repair and maintenance skills so that you can take care of your house and utilities without having to shell money out for a technician.\n\n\n* **Build Multiple Sources of Income**\n\n\nExplore ways to diversify your income. Multiple income streams provide financial security and increase your savings potential.\n\n\nConsider freelancing, consulting, tutoring, or offering services online. Websites and platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and TaskRabbit can connect you with potential clients.\n\n\nIf you have extra space or property, consider renting it out. This could involve renting a room in your home, leasing a vacation property, or even becoming a landlord for long-term rentals. Platforms like Airbnb and VRBO can help you list and manage short-term rentals.\n\n\nIf you enjoy writing, creating videos, or podcasting, you can monetize your content through platforms like YouTube, Twitch, or podcasting networks.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Keep Educating Yourself**\n\n\nStay informed about personal finance concepts, trends, and strategies. Read books, follow financial blogs or podcasts, and attend seminars or webinars. The more you educate yourself, the better equipped you\u2019ll be for effectively managing finances.\n\n\nFollowing the latest business and economic news is also very important as it determines macroeconomic trends and the performance of your investments.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Review and Update Your Financial Plan**\n\n\nSet aside time periodically to review how you are managing finances and make necessary adjustments. Life circumstances and financial goals can change, so it\u2019s important to ensure that your plan remains aligned with your current situation.\u00a0\n\n\nEvaluate your progress, reassess your goals, and adjust your strategies as needed to stay on track towards achieving financial success. Regularly monitoring your financial plan helps you identify any potential gaps or areas for improvement, allowing you to make informed decisions and adapt to changing circumstances effectively.\n\n\n* **Bonus tip! Choose the Right Financial Management Tools**\n\n\nWe are fortunate to live in a time where we have access to an abundance of tools and apps that help with managing finances. From expense management apps to budgeting apps, the support is endless.\n\n\nManaging finances is important for the individual, but is equally, if not more important for business owners. If you already own a business or are looking to open one, you need to pay extra attention to how you manage your finances.\n\n\nOne platform that is an absolute must for businesses today is RazorpayX. Built for growing businesses, the RazorpayX Current Account is a business banking hub that streamlines banking operations. Today companies like Swiggy, Hotstar, Nykaa, and Flipkart are a part of our ever-growing family.\n\n\n\n\n\n**The Bottom Line**\n-------------------\n\n\nRemember, managing finances is a journey that requires discipline and consistency. By implementing these tips, you\u2019ll be well on your way to achieving financial stability and building a prosperous future.\n\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n\n\n\n\n### How can I create a budget and effectively manage my personal finances?\n\n\n\nTo create a budget and effectively manage your personal finances, start by tracking your income and expenses.

Back then, the platform on [razorpay.com/docs](https://razorpay.com/docs/#home-payments) was much different than what you currently see. I remember quite liking it!\u00a0\n\n\nThe docs then had a landing page with the products and subproducts lined up perfectly. The horizontal product line had lovely icons with characteristic colours, and the navigation within those pages was basic and sufficient. It was functional, easy enough and assisted me as much as I requested. I was content with my search and collected positive impressions from repeated but minimal Docs usage.\u00a0\n\n\nWhich was why I was utterly bowled over when my manager, during the docs-introduction team-onboarding session, said:\u00a0\n\n\n\n> As you see, the functionality of Docs could be better\u2026\n> \n> \n\n\nI simply blinked my eyes at the Zoom screen-share in confusion.\u00a0\n\n\n**Design Thinking in Documentation**\n====================================\n\n\nThe notion of \u2018lack of functionality\u2019 is not a notion at all but a necessary metric to measure the usability of docs, qualitatively and quantitatively. Words like \u2018discoverability\u2019, \u2018user experience\u2019, and \u2018content-correctness\u2019 are used for the same reason.\u00a0\n\n\nThey are core objectives of designing documentation, visually and structurally. These have evolved over the many years of feedback from interviews and responses woven with design principles.\n\n\nAs for me, I did not realize all this back then. Nor did I know that the [current documentation style on Razorpay Docs](https://razorpay.com/docs/#home-payments), which had existed as a V2 Docs Beta then, was part of a redesign project\u2014a revamp that was learning to meet such core objectives of documentation.\u00a0\n\n\nIt resulted from design thinking\u2014a school of thought that I was yet to learn.\n\n\n**What is Design Thinking**\n---------------------------\n\n\nSo what is design thinking? To put it simply, it is the process of see-learn-invent-implement.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the documentation context, design thinking looks at how the user reads the documentation and intends to understand their pain points. Using those insights, it further develops, tests and implements possible solutions.\n\n\nThe approach of design thinking is standardised in a lot of blogs and books through a few steps, which are:\u00a0\n\n\n* Empathising with the users and identifying their problems\n* Defining the hurdles the users have to overcome in their journey\n* Brainstorming and coming up with the possible ideas\n* Generating prototypes of ideas and approaches\n* Testing, testing and more testing\n\n\n![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-at-10.37.52-1024x513.png)MIT Sloan Management School illustrates the Design Thinking process this way\nMy first project as an intern was to further reimagine the redesigned V2 Beta docs. In this project, I was to:\n\n\n1. Undertake a competitors\u2019 analysis between Razorpay and any select documentation sites of my choice.\n2. Write down what they have that Razorpay doesn\u2019t, and rate those docs.\n3. Present what ideas I had that would make Razorpay Docs better.\n\n\nI was *thrilled*, not just because this was a project right up my alley but also because I had resolved to get to the bottom of the \u2018lack of functionality\u2019 part.\n\n\n**Learning Design Thinking**\n============================\n\n\nYou do not *learn* Design Thinking; you *observe* it. When a process involves watching and learning, you grasp the requirements and then take action to resolve those pain points.\n\n\nAs a part of my project, I researched, observed and created ideas for documentation that resolved my pain points. Some elements I idealised in Docs based on my personal usage were:\n\n\n* Building a developer community for users, like many other documentation sites\n* Having better aesthetics with corresponding accessibility\n* Creating ingenious navigation and content-consumption mechanisms\n* Having alt text, videos with closed captions, and the like\n* Having tags for the individual pages to make navigation between pages more interactive and intuitive\n\n\nWhen I presented my findings, they were well received and appreciated. In that process, I came across my first and significant learning:\u00a0\n\n\n***Docs are designed to communicate and satisfy a two-way requirement.***\n\n\n* Every user that reaches the Docs has arrived with an intent: to find a resolution as quickly as possible.\n* Every Doc is created for one intent: Know what the user wants and fetch that information in record time.\n\n\nI resolved my pain points through this project while giving ideas based on my research. However, the work wasn\u2019t over; I still didn\u2019t see what the limitations of the functionality in the documentation were.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd so unwittingly, unknowingly, I explored design thinking\u2026 via design thinking.\n\n\n**Implementing Design Thinking**\n================================\n\n\nThe concept note for the redesigned Docs detailed the need for better discoverability and improved user experience. The redesigned docs proposed two significant enhancements:\n\n\n* Better discoverability: search experience and content navigation.\n* Simplified, more accessible content: content structure and layout and interactivity.\n\n\n![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-at-10.39.07-1024x581.png)The redesigned Razorpay Docs site\n**Aftermath**\n\n\nThe revamped documentation site, the one you see currently on Razorpay Docs, went live with these changes in June 2020. It was a sleek and energetic revamp. In the following months, our Docs Satisfaction measure (Docs CSAT, as we call it) soared.\n\n\nBut this was just the beginning. My own competition analysis detailed that a lot was yet to be done.\n\n\nMy second significant learning comes here:\u00a0\n\n\n***Design is a process, not a product. It is a continuous process.***\n\n\nConventionally, we say a product has a great design by its appearance. That\u2019s not wrong, but it is very generic. More often than not, it takes a while to recognise that in addition to its aesthetic value, we must look for its *functional* value too.\n\n\nRazorpay Docs in the V2 Beta looked better than the old one. It had a better aesthetic design, signature colours, visual indicators, and more. The Docs catered to the user well because it was designed well. And vice versa. It checked off many boxes:\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| \u2714\ufe0f | Functionality: can the Docs give users what they need for whatever reason they need it? |\n| \u2714\ufe0f | Aesthetics: how smartly does the appearance provide Razorpay\u2019s image and promise? |\n| \u2714\ufe0f | Discoverability: can the users find the items they are looking for?\u00a0 |\n| \u2714\ufe0f | Navigation: how well are users able to locate and contextualize the information?\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| \u2714\ufe0f | User experience: how is the overall experience and satisfaction of the users? |\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Docs Redesign in June 2022 was a one-time project, but we had to reach multiple other destinations. So we took measures to build upon that.\n\n\n**Design Thinking is a Continuous Process**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhen design itself is a process, how could design thinking not be one too? Experts claim this openly: design thinking is **not** a linear, single-track process. It is messy and repetitive, and what worked at first might not make sense after a while.\n\n\n***No matter how high you soar, you still scratch surfaces again. You must.***\n\n\nAfter the new designs went live, we worked on improving the documentation a whole lot more. What we have improved since then is for you to discover and tell us how you feel about it via the User Feedback module.\u00a0\n\n\nAs for what we continued to do, we did that by taking up projects to understand the user. These worked initially, but we soon reached a stagnation point. Then we changed our approach and will change it again when applicable. That\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n**In Hindsight**\n----------------\n\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t make sense to talk so much about design thinking if I do not see how it applies to designing my write-ups. My writing and my understanding towards writing technical content have evolved in the process, and I am still imbibing my third learning:\u00a0\n\n\n***Write with solid intent after understanding the user persona.***\n\n\nIt reflects the most in my structuring and language, a stark but gradual shift from the write-ups I created as a Content Writer. What I wrote once was a glorifying advertising stunt, which has now become informative and immediately actionable.\u00a0\n\n\nIntentional writing understands the users\u2019 needs and provides the necessary information. If not intentional, documentation will fail its core objectives.\n\n\n**To Conclude**\n===============\n\n\nA massive chunk of Docs relies on the content, the raw material that must be written intentionally and is easy to consume. Talking to users and understanding where they are struggling with the content, design, structure, information, and experience is the key to creating incredible documentation.\n\n\nDocs are an essential aid in helping users understand what the product offers. It is a great self-help tool that allows users to understand concepts, explain how-tos, help them integrate and troubleshoot. By using design thinking in the authoring, designing and delivery process, you always maintain sight of your users; the outcome is invaluable.", "[May 21, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/why-do-we-need-visual-aids-in-tech-writing/)\n\n4 Mins Read\n\n\nA few days ago, I bought a new smartphone\u2014one of the new flashy models which contains more bells and whistles than I could ever need. I am decently comfortable with new-age devices, but this one had me scratching my head. I just could not figure out how to insert the second SIM card along with the memory card. After much tinkering, I decided to give the official user guide a shot. Only after I looked at the booklet and studied the visual instructions did things start making sense. I was finally able to complete my task.\n\n\nVisual elements in technical documentation help end users absorb complex information, understand new concepts and finish their tasks faster.\n\n\nTypes of Visual Aids\n====================\n\n\nThere are different types of visual aids that tech writers can add to enrich the\u00a0content.\n\n\n* Charts and Diagrams: Flow charts help users to understand processes from start to end. By having a pictorial representation, users can grasp the process and ensure that they do not miss out on any of the key steps. [Sample flow chart](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/browser/assets/images/payment-links-pl-workflow.jpg).\n\n\n![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/payment-links-pl-workflow.jpg)\n\n\n* Infographics: Oftentimes, it is crucial to highlight certain calculations and values in the documentation. Having them in tables or paragraph format might make users overlook them due to the information overload. Infographics make it easier to visualise data. [Sample infographic](https://blog.razorpay.in/blog-content/uploads/2018/11/Full-Infographic-2.0-Compressed.png).\n\n\n![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/Full-Infographic-2.0-Compressed.png)\n\n\n* Videos and GIFs: Explainer videos, with or without voiceover, are excellent resources for users to quickly learn about products, concepts and procedural steps. [Sample video](https://youtu.be/86ngp6VY-I8)\n\n\n![](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/video-aid.png)\n\n\n* Screenshots: Product UI images that help the user connect the instructions to the interface. [Sample screenshots](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/easy-create-account#contact-details)\n\n\n4 Reasons Visual Aids Are Important\n===================================\n\n\n1. Simplifies complex content\n\n\nThe most important reason to add visual aids such as screenshots and diagrams is to break the content into smaller, understandable pieces. This simplification enables the user to grasp the concepts better. The visual cues help them to relate to the ideas better.\n\n\nFor example, in the aviation industry, flight manuals come with detailed diagrams and images to ensure pilots and other officials can absorb the information well. Another example is a map that helps users navigate or understand the layout of complex buildings.\n\n\n2. Improves retention\n\n\nOur minds are able to retain details when it is displayed to us in visual form. The usage of vivid colours and shapes helps our brains to store information. [Studies](https://www.t-sciences.com/news/humans-process-visual-data-better) have shown that people are more likely to remember information when it is presented in a visual format. Compared to text, images are processed by the human brain at a speed 60,000 times faster. Furthermore, visual information accounts for 90 percent of the information that is transmitted to the brain.\n\n\n3. Saves time\n\n\nSome users are visual learners. Sometimes users do not have enough time or do not want to put in the effort of going through lengthy text. They want to quickly get the information they need to go ahead and get the job done.\u00a0\n\n\nIn fact, at Razorpay, when we conducted [feedback sessions with users](https://razorpay.com/learn/user-feedback/#:~:text=and%20gather%20feedback.-,User%20Interviews,-%3A%20The%20best) to understand the efficacy of our documents, we realised that users preferred watching our dashboard videos rather than reading the steps. Videos definitely help in faster dissemination of information.\n\n\n4. Improves accessibility\n\n\nAdding visual elements makes your documentation accessible to a wider audience. For example, readers who may struggle with written language can benefit from the use of visual aids such as images, diagrams, or videos.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the case of visual impairments, visual aids can provide alternative ways of presenting information through braille, tactile images, or audio descriptions.\n\n\nEnding Notes\n============\n\n\nWhen selecting a visual aid, it is critical to consider the purpose of the writing, the target audience, and the type of information. Visual aids are powerful tools for writers looking to enhance content clarity, engagement, and memorability. When used effectively, visual aids can add an element of creativity and interest to a piece of writing, making it more enjoyable for readers to engage with.\u00a0\n\n\nStart using visual aids to enhance the communication process and improve the overall quality of your writing.", "[May 21, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/breaking-down-the-requirements-for-accepting-international-payments-through-razorpay/)\n\n5 Mins Read\n\n\nAre you an entrepreneur looking to expand your business globally?

This includes budgeting, saving, spending, and investing. Money management proves even more beneficial with regular financial planning.\u00a0\n\n\nMoney management facilitates business growth and the future financial standing of the business entity. In addition, it helps business professionals handle their earnings efficiently and make decisions that will improve their financial status.\u00a0\n\n\n**How to Manage Money Better?**\n-------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Maintain a Budget**\n\n\nThe first step towards money management or maintaining business funds is to adhere to effective budgeting. Mention all the liabilities, expenses and prepare a budget. Remember, drafting a budget is never enough and will not prove advantageous until it is put to use. Thus, business owners must refer to it frequently before spending or making any financial decision.\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, the budget list must be updated as soon as a business initiates its bill payments, vendor payments, etc. Business owners need to have an idea of the budget at any given point of the month. Also, not every detail is related to money that a business needs to spend or expenses it needs to initiate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Track Spending**\n\n\nOne of the most important ways one can ensure effective money management is to track spending. Small purchases add to the expenses quickly and in an instant, the business owners can overspend their budget.\u00a0\n\n\nHence, it is extremely important to start tracking spending and identify areas where one tends to spend more. In this regard, business owners can save receipts, categorise the expenses, jot down purchases and expenses in a spending journal, etc. It will help in keeping the spending under control.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Set a Limit for the Unbudgeted Spending**\n\n\nA major part of budgeting is that business owners have to decide what they must do with the net income that is left once they deduct necessary expenditures from their earnings. After preparing a proper budget, a business can use this unbudgeted portion for recreational purposes.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, even while doing so, business owners must exercise control. Before spending money on recreational purposes or making hefty purchases, it is important to ensure that the spending does not affect other planned expenses.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Avoid Committing to Recurring Monthly Bills**\n\n\nEven if business owners are eligible for availing loans owing to their stable income and credit availability, they must refrain from doing it if not required. A financial institution is aware of the income that borrowers have reported to them and the debt liabilities that are mentioned in the credit report. It is up to the business owners to understand whether or not a monthly payment will be feasible for them to clear out payments depending on their income and other financial liabilities.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Ensure to Stick to the Best Price**\n\n\nBusiness owners must compare different price quotes to make sure that they are bearing the lowest cost for a particular service or product. It will help them save a substantial amount which can be used to fund other business operations. In addition, business professionals can look for coupons, discounts, and other cost-effective means to refrain from exceeding their budget.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Save for Making Big Purchases**\n\n\nAnother effective way by which business owners can manage cash flow is by incorporating the practice of delaying gratification. It goes a long way in helping one to save a considerable amount.\u00a0\n\n\nDelay or stop oneself from making large purchases and instead focus on purchasing essential business items. It will help business owners understand whether investing a hefty amount is worthwhile.\u00a0 By doing so, business owners can save up money instead of bearing interest on credit cards.\n\n\n* ### **Minimise Credit Card Purchases**\n\n\nRelying on credit card purchases can prompt one to spend more than budgeted. Hence it is always advised to minimise credit card purchases. There is a tendency for business owners to use credit cards when they run short of cash. This practice must be avoided in order to ensure smooth cash flow.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Make Regular Contributions to Savings**\n\n\nKeeping aside a certain amount of money is a positive step towards a healthy financial habit. Business owners can set up this process in ways where the amount gets automatically debited and gets transferred to the savings account.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is an effective way to ensure an effective money management process. Even by doing so, business owners can create an emergency fund that will help them stay afloat during unforeseen circumstances.\u00a0\n\n\n**How RazorpayX Assists Businesses with Robust Business Process**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[RazorpayX](https://razorpay.com/x/), a banking suite, helps businesses in manifold ways.

Hence, it is important to know what is to be done with the money both in the long and short term. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Does availing too many loans impact the money management process?\n\n\n\nBusiness owners must not apply for too many loans, as it will add to the debt burden, which affects the money management process severely. It can also affect their credit score, which will prevent them from taking loans in the future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is money management in financial markets?\n\n\n\nMoney management in a financial market refers to portfolio management or investment management. In this type of investment, firms supervise a pool of capital from clients and invest the same in different assets to get higher returns. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n### How does an investment strategy help in money management?\n\n\n\nIt is suggested to save up money and use it to make an investment, even if the individual\u2019s potential is limited. Making smaller investments in investment accounts will help an individual use their income to ensure more income.", "[May 18, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/call-and-put-option/)\n\n6 Mins Read\n\n\nCall and put options refer to the derivatives or financial contracts under which buyers have the right to purchase and sell an underlying asset. This asset can be a commodity, stock, bond etc., bought or sold within a certain date or strike price. Here, buyers only have a right and not an obligation to do so.\n\n\nThese options do not have a worth of their own and derive value from those of underlying assets.\u00a0 As both these options are buyer\u2019s rights and not their obligations, hence these are regarded as asymmetrical options.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n* [Difference Between Call and Put Option](#Difference-Between-Call-and-Put-Option \"Difference Between Call and Put Option\")\n* [What are Option Premiums?](#What-are-Option-Premiums \"What are Option Premiums?\")\n* [How Do Call Options Work?](#How-Do-Call-Options-Work \"How Do Call Options Work?\")\n* [How to Calculate Call Option Payoffs?](#How-to-Calculate-Call-Option-Payoffs \"How to Calculate Call Option Payoffs?\")\n* [How Do Put Options Work?](#How-Do-Put-Options-Work \"How Do Put Options Work?\")\n* [How to Calculate Put Option Payoffs?](#How-to-Calculate-Put-Option-Payoffs \"How to Calculate Put Option Payoffs?\")\n* [How Small Business Can Benefit from RazorpayX Offerings?](#How-Small-Business-Can-Benefit-from-RazorpayX-Offerings \"How Small Business Can Benefit from RazorpayX Offerings?\")\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](#Frequently-Asked-Questions \"Frequently Asked Questions\")\n\n**Difference Between Call and Put Option**\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n* **Definition:** The main difference between a call and a put option is that one deals with buying an asset and the latter deals with selling an underlying asset.\n* **Reason:** Buyers of call options anticipate that stock prices will rise. Conversely, buyers of the put option expect the stock price will fall.\n* **Right & Obligation:** The call option indicates the right of a buyer to buy an underlying asset at a fixed price at a future date. The price at which they will buy is pre-defined and is determined today. In contrast, the put option refers to the right of selling an asset at a future date, this price is again decided today. However, after selling, the seller falls under the obligation to purchase an asset if its buyer exercises his/her option.\n* **Future View:** Traders who opt for a call option at the strike price have a negative view that the stock price will stay less than its strike price. The selling of this call option will lead to a break-even for sellers as they will get the strike price plus the premium fee.\n\n\nHowever, for sellers of put options, they have a view that the stock price will stay above its strike price. Here, a break-even is the difference between the option\u2019s strike price and its premium received.\n\n\n* **Chances of Profit:** Opting for a call option will result in higher profit only if the value of the contract or underlying asset is increasing. In contrast, holders can ensure profit from a put option only if their underlying asset\u2019s value is decreasing or falling.\n* **Percentage of Potential Gain:** Potential gain in a call option is unlimited as there is no mathematical limitation in the underlying asset\u2019s rising price. However, the potential gain in a put option has a limit as the price of an underlying asset can technically never be zero.\n* **Meaning of \u2018in-the-money\u2019 & \u2018out-of-the-money\u2019:** Call and put option involves in-the-money or out-of-the-money scenarios. If the spot price of a call option is higher than that of its strike price, it is referred to as in-the-money. In case a call option\u2019s spot price is less than that of its strike price, it is referred to as out-of-the-money.\n\n\nConversely, under a put option, in-the-money is termed when spot prices are less than strike prices. However, when the spot price of an underlying asset exceeds its strike price, it is an out-of-the-money put option.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Effect on its Value:** As the data of dividend nears, there is a loss of value of the call option. However, in the case of a put option, its value increases.\n\n\n**What are Option Premiums?**\n-----------------------------\n\n\nOptions premiums refer to the amount that traders have to pay for a put or a call option. In other words, it is the cost that they have to bear for exercising this right.\u00a0\n\n\nThree factors namely volatility level, underlying contract and expiry time influence the option premium. Mathematically, the option premium can be evaluated as the sum of the option\u2019s time value and the option\u2019s intrinsic value.\u00a0\n\n\n**How Do Call Options Work?**\n-----------------------------\n\n\nInvestors opt for a call option only when they see that the underlying asset\u2019s price has increased.\u00a0 This particular contract is formulated based on a securities exchange. In this option, the seller conducts a transaction with option buyers where the seller gives a right (not obligation) to buyers to obtain a particular security at a certain price.\u00a0\n\n\n**How to Calculate Call Option Payoffs?**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nIn a call option, payoffs are the profit or loss that option buyers or sellers earn. The strike price, expiry date and premium are variables depending on which computation of call options takes place. Even these variables help evaluate call option payoffs.\u00a0\n\n\nFormulas that are used for computing payoff and profit amount for call option buyers are-\n\n\n* Payoff = Spot Price \u2013 Strike Price\n* Profit = Payoff \u2013 Premium Paid\n\n\nFormulas used for a payoff for call options for sellers are-\u00a0\n\n\n* Payoff = Spot price \u2013 Strike Price\n* Profit = Payoff + Premium Paid\n\n\n**How Do Put Options Work?**\n----------------------------\n\n\nSeveral ways are there using which investors can complete or close options trade. So, in case an option expires profitable, investors can exercise it. In case an option proves unprofitable, then its investor loses the money used to pay the option.\n\n\nThis put option carries chances of ensuring higher value which is indicative that the put option premium increases as an underlying stock price falls and vice versa. In addition, the put option, when exercised, extends investors a selling position in a stock. Hence, this option helps safeguard investors from downward moves in a long stock position.\u00a0\n\n\n**How to Calculate Put Option Payoffs?**\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nIn the case of payoffs for put option buyers, the buyer\u2019s profit or loss on the option is based on its underlying asset\u2019s spot price.\u00a0 If the spot price is lower than its strike price when it expires, then buyers will benefit from massive profit.\u00a0\n\n\nNow in case of payoff for put option sellers, the seller levies a premium fee. Here, the profit or loss is based on its spot price. So, the amount of profit that the buyers make is equivalent to the loss that the seller incurs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**How Small Business Can Benefit from RazorpayX Offerings?**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[RazorpayX](https://razorpay.com/x/) supercharges business baking, thus making it handy for small businesses and startup-ups in several regards.

This amount is non-refundable. \nSettlement: Options contracts or derivatives are sorted out as cash in India. \nSpot price: It refers to the underlying asset's current price within the stock market. \nOption expiry: It is the time when the option contracts will expire.\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is the strike price?\n\n\n\nThe strike price is the specified price at which the underlying asset is sold or purchased by a buyer after a specific period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### How are time decay and time value in option premiums related?\n\n\n\nTime decay, or time to expiration, is a vital factor that influences the time value of option premiums. Time decay does not have a bearing on intrinsic value. However, it affects the option\u2019s time value, thereby affecting the option premium significantly. In the case of the call and put option, the longer the time decay, the higher the option's time value, which is indicative of a higher option premium.", "[May 16, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/flash-sale-guide/)\n\n9 Mins Read\n\n\nFlash sales, also known as \u201cdeals of the day,\u201d have the capacity to boost sales. Flash sales create FOMO (fear of missing out) among online shoppers and compel them to make impulse purchases. In India, flash sales during Diwali account for 30-40% of a complete year\u2019s sales.\n\n\nWhat is a Flash Sale?\n=====================\n\n\nA flash sale is an event offered by eCommerce businesses and platforms where products are sold at a significantly lower price for a limited time. The primary purpose of a flash sale is to foster a sense of urgency among online shoppers to buy products and increase sales. This also compels them to explore other products they haven\u2019t considered buying. A flash sale can offer discounts of up to 80% on regular MRPs.\n\n\nHere are a few instances that will help you understand whether a flash sale is a good strategy for your eCommerce business or not:\n\n\n1. Some of your old products that aren\u2019t selling have been in the warehouse for too long.\n2. Your inventory has overstock products and taking up space, and you need room for new products.\n3. You want to drive traffic to your online store, boost revenue, gain new customers, and engage with existing inactive customers.\n4. You want to boost brand awareness. Although a flash sale is a short-term event, it can still educate customers about your brand and products.\n\n\nBest Practices for Running a Successful Flash Sale\n==================================================\n\n\nTaking a strategic approach when planning for your flash sales is advisable. Here are the parameters that can help you:\u00a0\n\n\nSetting Clear Goals for Your Flash Sale\n---------------------------------------\n\n\n![flash sale goals](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/Goal-300x180.png)A flash sale can help you accomplish a host of things. Start your journey by thinking about the goal of your flash sale. Do you want to liquidate old inventory? Do you have new items coming up, and do you want to sell them first? Do you want to boost sales quickly and generate hype for your brand or a new product? Once you are clear about your goal and the thought process, planning will also fall into place. Meaning when to launch a flash sale, which item to display for sale, and the discount you want to offer will become much more precise.  \n\n\n\n\nTiming: Choosing the Right Moment for Your Flash Sale\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n![right sale timing](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/Timing-300x192.jpg)Although flash sales are popular during the festive seasons, such as Diwali, Holi, Valentine\u2019s Day, etc., you need to know whether your products will sell out during the festive season or not. Do you have products that online shoppers look for during the festive season? Launching a flash sale on every festive occasion may not be worth it for everyone, but understanding your business, products, and selecting the correct date and time will surely help you.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you have an online gift store, offering discounts on roses, soft toys, and perfumes during Valentine\u2019s day, Rakshabandhan, EID, etc. will make more sense than on Diwali. Sweets and dry fruits, for example, have better chances of being sold out during Diwali.\u00a0\n\n\nEffective Promotion Strategy for Flash Sales\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n![flash sale promotion](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/display-products-300x200.jpg)\n\n\nJust like artists start promoting the release date of their new song, do the same thing for your flash sale as well. Start talking about your flash sale ahead of time. Reiterate the urgency and let your customers know what they would miss if they missed the flash sale. The thumb rule is to generate hype about your flash sale to drive traffic to your online store and sell out products fast. Leverage social media to make announcements, add pop-ups on the home page, and send emails reminding customers of the sweet deal on their way.\n\n\nCross-Selling: Enhancing Customer Experience\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n![cross sale during flash sale](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/cross-sell-300x200.jpg)As an eCommerce business, it\u2019s essential to promote a diverse range of products, and cross-selling can be a highly effective way to achieve this goal. However, not every product you cross-sell needs to be discounted. The primary objective is to help customers discover relevant products and encourage them to shop more.\n\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced world, online shoppers value convenience and efficiency. They prefer to save time while shopping and make purchases quickly. Cross-selling can streamline the shopping experience by eliminating the need to navigate to the product page to explore related items. When offering discounts, consider aligning complementary products during cross-sell to increase the likelihood of purchase.\n\n\nFor instance, if you\u2019re selling shoes, you can cross-sell socks to enhance the customer\u2019s experience. Similarly, if you\u2019re selling mobile phones, consider offering cases for the same model and other accessories that may be of interest to the buyer.\n\n\n*Read Also:* [*Upsell and Cross Sell Like a Pro*](https://razorpay.com/learn/upsell-and-cross-sell-like-a-pro/)\n\n\nData-Driven Decisions: Displaying Products Based on Analytics\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n![display products carefully](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/Online-shopping-300x169.jpg)To be sure about the products to display on sale, take advantage of analytics. Scrutinize your customer data. Find out which geographical locations your customers are from, their buying habits, their gender, which of your products get sold off easily and which ones don\u2019t, and more. Running a successful flash sale is all about understanding your audiences\u2019 buying behavior; once you know that, getting the drift of which products to sell, to whom, and when will become more evident.  \n\n\n\n\n**Compelling Messaging: The Art of Persuasion in Flash Sales**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n![happy customer](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/sway-customers-300x200.jpg)You will offer a flash sale for a reason. To make your customers want to buy from you, you must make them believe the flash sale will benefit them. Discount is there, which is good in itself, but the key messaging also matters a lot when you market your flash sale. It is advisable to focus on context and clarity. For example, if you sell an item worth 100 rupees, 10 rupees off won\u2019t be as appealing as 10% off. Likewise, if the product is worth 5,000 rupees, saying 500 rupees off will be better than saying 10% off. Although you are offering discounts in both cases, it\u2019s the way you say it that matters.  \n\n\n\n\n*Read Also:* [*Instagram Marketing Strategy*](https://razorpay.com/blog/instagram-marketing-strategy/)\n\n\n**Inventory Management: Ensuring Sufficient Stock for Your Flash Sale**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n![e-commerce warehouse](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/Warehouse-300x169.jpg)A flash sale needs adequate preparation.

It refers to transactions and activities related to raising capital to develop, acquire and create a business.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCorporate finance is directly related to the organisation\u2019s decisions which have a monetary or financial impact. Think of it as a liaison between the company and the capital market.\n\n\nOne of its key objectives is maximising shareholder value via short and long-term financial planning and implementation of different strategies. Corporate finance-related activities include financial planning, budgeting, tax planning, and investment of idle money for maximum returns.\n\n\nCorporate finance plays a major role in all businesses. Regardless of the type or size of business operations, all enterprises aim at streamlining their corporate financing arm to generate better returns and optimal wealth distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Does Corporate Finance Work\n-------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate finance operates by employing various financial principles and techniques to manage a company\u2019s financial activities. It involves assessing investment opportunities, estimating their potential returns, and conducting financial analysis to guide decision-making. Corporate finance professionals determine the optimal mix of debt and equity financing to fund operations and projects, taking into account factors such as risk, cost of capital, and financial leverage.\n\n\nThey also engage in financial planning, forecasting, and budgeting to ensure effective resource allocation. Additionally, corporate finance involves evaluating and managing financial risks through strategies like hedging and insurance. Ultimately, the goal of corporate finance is to maximize shareholder value by making informed financial decisions that align with the company\u2019s strategic objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Finance Principles\n----------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate finance principles encompass a set of guiding principles and concepts that underpin financial decision-making within a corporation. Some key principles include:\n\n\n* **Value Maximization:** The primary goal of corporate finance is to maximize shareholder value. Financial decisions should be made with the objective of increasing the wealth of shareholders over the long term.\n* **Time Value of Money:** The principle that money today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to the potential for growth and investment returns. This principle is crucial for assessing investment opportunities and determining the value of future cash flows.\n* **Risk-Return Tradeoff:** The principle that higher returns are generally associated with higher risks. Corporate finance involves evaluating and managing risks to strike a balance between risk and return in investment decisions.\n* **Cost of Capital:** The cost of capital refers to the rate of return that a company must earn on its investments to satisfy the expectations of its investors. It encompasses both the cost of debt and the cost of equity and is a critical factor in capital budgeting decisions.\n* **Capital Structure:** The mix of debt and equity financing used by a company to fund its operations. Corporate finance principles guide the determination of the optimal capital structure, considering factors such as the cost of capital, risk profile, and financial flexibility.\n* **Diversification:** Spreading investments across different assets and markets to reduce risk. Diversification is an important principle in corporate finance to minimize exposure to specific risks and create a well-balanced investment portfolio.\n* **Agency Theory:** Recognizing the potential conflicts of interest between shareholders and managers, and implementing mechanisms to align their interests. This principle involves designing effective corporate governance structures and incentives to ensure management acts in the best interests of shareholders.\n\n\nCentral Elements of Corporate Finance\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nIndeed, capital budgeting, capital structure, working capital management, and dividend distribution are central elements of corporate finance. Here\u2019s a brief explanation of each:\n\n\n* ### Capital Budgeting\n\n\nCapital budgeting involves evaluating and selecting investment opportunities that will yield long-term benefits for the company. This process includes analyzing potential projects, estimating their cash flows, assessing their risks, and determining their financial viability. The goal is to allocate capital to projects that will generate the highest returns and contribute to the company\u2019s overall growth and profitability.\n\n\n* ### Capital Structure\n\n\nCapital structure refers to the mix of debt and equity financing used by a company to fund its operations and investments. Corporate finance professionals analyze various sources of funding and determine the optimal balance between debt and equity to minimize the cost of capital while considering risk, financial flexibility, and the company\u2019s capital needs. The objective is to strike a balance that maximizes shareholder value while maintaining a sustainable and stable financial structure.\n\n\n* ### Working Capital\n\n\nWorking capital represents the funds necessary to cover a company\u2019s day-to-day operational expenses and short-term obligations. It includes cash, inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Effective working capital management ensures that the company has sufficient liquidity to meet its short-term obligations while optimizing the use of its current assets and liabilities. Balancing working capital is essential to maintain operational efficiency, support growth, and manage cash flow effectively.\n\n\n* ### Dividend Distribution\n\n\nDividend distribution is the process of distributing profits or earnings to shareholders. The decision to pay dividends and the amount distributed depends on factors such as the company\u2019s financial performance, cash flow position, growth opportunities, and dividend policy. Corporate finance professionals assess these factors to determine an appropriate dividend policy that strikes a balance between reinvesting profits for growth and returning value to shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Corporate Finance\n--------------------------\n\n\n**1. Equity Financing:** This type of financing involves raising capital by issuing shares of stock to investors. It is the process of raising capital by selling shares to investors and the public.\n\n\n**2. Debt Financing:** This type of financing involves borrowing money from lenders such as banks, institutions, and other financial institutions. The company must repay the loan with interest over a predetermined period of time.\n\n\n**3. Venture Capital:** Venture capital is financing provided by venture capital firms or professional investors to start\u2013up companies or other businesses with the potential for long\u2013term growth.\n\n\n**4. Mergers and Acquisitions:** Mergers and acquisitions are transactions in which two companies combine to form one larger company. The larger company is usually the acquirer, while the smaller company is usually the target. The acquirer usually pays a premium to the target in order to obtain control over it.\n\n\n**5. Private Equity Financing:** Private equity financing refers to the issuance of securities to private investors in exchange for capital. Private equity financing is typically used to finance companies without access to public capital markets.\n\n\n**6. Leveraged Buyouts:** Leveraged buyouts involve the use of debt financing to acquire a company. The acquirer typically takes out a loan to purchase the target company and then uses the target company\u2018s assets as collateral for the loan.\n\n\n**7. Initial Public Offerings**: An initial public offering (IPO) is a type of public offering in which shares of a company are sold to investors. IPOs are typically used to fund the expansion of a company.\n\n\n**8. Mezzanine Financing:** Mezzanine financing is a type of financing that combines debt and equity. The debt portion is typically referred to as a mezzanine loan, while the equity portion is called a mezzanine equity investment.\n\n\n**9. Asset-Backed Financing:** Asset\u2013backed financing is a type of financing in which assets are used as collateral for a loan. The assets can include accounts receivable, inventory, machinery, and real estate.\n\n\n**Activities That Govern Corporate Finance**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe top three activities that primarily govern corporate financing are:\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Return of capital and dividends**\n\n\nThis requires corporate managers to decide whether to distribute the earnings to shareholders in the form of share buybacks or dividends or to retain the excess earnings of a business for future operational requirements and investments.\n\n\nRetained earnings that are not distributed to shareholders should be utilised to fund the expansion of a business. It does not dilute the value of equity by issuing more shares or incurring additional debts. That\u2019s why this often proves to be the best source of funds.\n\n\nEventually, as someone managing corporate finance, you must pursue a capital investment if there are chances of earning a rate of return on it, which is higher than the organisation\u2019s cost of capital. Otherwise, they must return the excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks or dividends.\n\n\n* ### **Capital budgeting and investments**\n\n\nCapital budgeting and investing include planning regarding where to place the long-term capital assets of an organisation to produce the highest risk-adjusted returns. This involves deciding whether to pursue an investment opportunity or not and is accomplished via extensive financial analysis.\n\n\nBy utilising financial accounting tools, you can estimate cash flows from proposed capital projects, can compare planned investments with projected income, identify capital expenditures, and decide which projects you should include in the capital budget.\n\n\nFinancial modelling is utilised to forecast an investment opportunity\u2019s economic impact and compare alternative projects. Many times, an analyst uses the Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) to draw a comparison between projects and choose the optimal one.\n\n\n* ### **Capital Financing**\n\n\nCapital financing includes decisions regarding how to finance capital investments optimally via the business\u2019 debt, equity, or a combination of both.\n\n\nYou can acquire long-term funding for major capital investments or expenditures by issuing debt securities in the market via investment banks, or by selling company stock.\n\n\nThe key is to balance the two sources (debt and equity). Eventually, corporate finance professionals optimise the capital structure of an organisation by reducing its WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) as much as possible.\n\n\n**Benefits of Corporate Finance**\n---------------------------------\n\n\nHere are some of the major benefits of corporate financing.\u00a0\n\n\n#### **1. Efficient business operations**\n\n\nWell-planned\u00a0corporate finance ensures that your business\u2019 finances are in top shape and capital allocation is streamlined effectively.\u00a0\n\n\nThis means that your loans are cleared on time, you are able to buy raw materials as required, employee salaries are paid on time, new product launches go as planned, and marketing efforts for said new products, as well as the existing ones, are well-budgeted.\n\n\n#### **2. Research and development**\n\n\nMarket and product research requires considerable funding resources, both material and human, to be conducted effectively. Running out of funding at any point during the process would mean a lot of work and work hours going to waste. Well-planned corporate finance would help ensure steady financial support for research efforts that ultimately help your business succeed.\n\n\n#### **3. Keeps expansion plans on track**\n\n\nModern techniques and equipment are necessary for the diversification and expansion of an enterprise. Planning yourcorporate finance in advance will ensure that\u00a0you have a steady flow of funds to acquire future-forward technology and equipment for your business.\n\n\n#### **4. Operation management**\n\n\nCorporate finance plays a vital role in the coordination and control of various activities in an enterprise. For instance, your production will drop if the finance department does not offer sufficient finance to buy raw materials and meet other daily financial needs for running the production unit smoothly.

Cart abandonment is not unheard of, but how many e-commerce stores actually take this vital metric seriously?\n\n\nCart Abandonment Rate: The Grim Statistics\n==========================================\n\n\nFiguring out the reasons behind a high abandoned cart rate is crucial. The higher the abandoned cart rate, the lower the sales will be, and conversely, the lower the abandoned cart rate, the higher the revenue generation. Therefore, the primary task for any e-commerce business is to identify factors that may be impacting their sales and implement strategic solutions to reduce the abandoned cart rate.\n\n\n1. According to the [Baymard Institute](https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate), the average rate of abandoned carts stands at 70%. This translates to a scenario where out of 10 visitors to an online store, 7 leave their carts behind, leaving only 3 to successfully complete the purchase process.\n2. Barilliance reveals an intriguing statistic: the average cart abandonment rate for desktop users hovers at 73.07%. Surprisingly, despite the comfort and convenience that desktops offer for navigating e-commerce stores, customers are still inclined to part ways with their filled carts.\n3. [Barilliance](https://www.barilliance.com/cart-abandonment-rate-statistics/) also analyzed the pattern of the abandoned carts rate among tablet users, and according to them, 80% of tablet users abandon their carts. This means that if 10 people have visited an online store, only 2 people completed their transaction process and purchased something.\n4. The most concerning statistic, however, pertains to mobile users. Among them, the cart abandonment rate skyrockets to a striking 85.65%. This number, in contrast to tablet and desktop figures, stands as a significant setback. For businesses that predominantly cater to mobile users, this underscores a substantial revenue loss.\n\n\n\n> \n> Key Takeaway\n> ------------\n> \n> \n> Mobile users notably surpass tablet and desktop users in volume. Regrettably, this surge in mobile traffic corresponds to the highest rate of abandoned carts \u2013 an alarming 85.65%.\n> \n> \n\n\n10 Reasons Your Cart Abandonment Rate is High\n=============================================\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cart Abandonment Reason** | **Cart Abandoners (in %)** |\n| Lack of mobile-friendly UI | 53% |\n| Added charges, elevating total cost | 47% |\n| Unnecessary account creation | 25% |\n| Slow delivery of products | 24% |\n| Concerns regarding sharing credit card information | 19% |\n| Multiple steps to complete purchase\u00a0 | 18% |\n| Return policy fails to meet expectations | 16% |\n| Frequent crashes and loading problems | 14% |\n| Unavailability of preferred payment option | 11% |\n| Promo or coupon codes unavailable | 8% |\n\n\nLack of Mobile-Friendly UI\n--------------------------\n\n\nThe number of mobile phone users is constantly growing, with over 60% of customers now shopping from their mobile devices. If your website isn\u2019t responsive to different screen sizes, it can look messy on smaller screens, making it hard to navigate and disrupting the smooth shopping experience. Problems like struggling to find products, accessing the shopping cart, or completing the checkout process can frustrate users and lead to abandoned carts.\n\n\n### What to Do:\n\n\nIf you have an e-commerce store and your website is not mobile-optimized, you are losing out on half of your potential customers.\u00a0\n\n\n* Prioritize the implementation of a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. This ensures that the UI remains user-friendly on all devices.\n* Simplify the navigation process for mobile users. Prioritize key elements such as search bars, shopping carts, and menus for easy access.\n* Adding a progress bar that informs customers about the steps they have completed and the next ones they need to follow can help keep them well-informed and less likely to abandon their carts.\n* Optimize images and website elements for faster loading on mobile devices. Speed is crucial for retaining users\u2019 attention. Design touch-friendly buttons and forms that are easy to interact with using fingers, reducing friction in completing essential actions.\n\n\nAdded Charges, Elevating Total Cost\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nWhen customers begin their shopping journey, they naturally expect transparency and fair pricing. Discovering extra charges at the last moment can be jarring and may even cause abandoned carts. These unexpected costs create a psychological effect known as \u2018sticker shock,\u2019 where the perceived value of the product suddenly changes due to an unforeseen price increase.\n\n\n### What to Do:\n\n\nTransparency is vital in fostering trust between customers and businesses. Unexpected costs can lead to a feeling of deception, eroding the trust customers have in the brand.\u00a0\n\n\n* Display all potential additional charges upfront, even before customers add items to their carts. This approach sets accurate expectations from the beginning.\n* During the shopping journey, provide clear information regarding potential extra costs. Implement tooltips or small pop-up messages that explain why these costs exist and how they contribute to the overall value.\n* Integrate shipping calculators that allow customers to estimate costs based on their location before they proceed to checkout.\n* Consider offering free shipping for orders over a certain amount. Highlighting this threshold can encourage customers to add more items to their carts, offsetting the extra cost.\n\n\nUnnecessary Account Creation\n----------------------------\n\n\n![Avoid Unnecessary Account Creation to reduce cart abandonment rate](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/learn-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2-image-2.png)\n\n\nThe checkout process stands as a crucial juncture in the online shopping journey, but a major obstacle that often leads to abandoned carts is the requirement for users to create accounts unnecessarily. Requiring users to fill out extensive forms for account creation elongates the checkout process, testing their patience and making them rethink their purchase decision. Many customers are looking for a quick, one-time transaction. Demanding account creation implies a long-term commitment, deterring users from seeking a swift and hassle-free experience.\n\n\n\n> At least 24% of customers abandon their carts because they are asked to create an account.\u00a0\n> \n> \n\n\n### What to Do:\n\n\nThink of making the checkout journey as smooth as possible for your customers. The faster the checkout process is, the faster the transaction will be completed.\u00a0\n\n\n* Prioritize a guest checkout option that enables users to complete their purchase without the necessity of creating an account. Razorpay\u2019s Magic Checkout provides a seamless one-time OTP authentication, eliminating the need for account creation.\n* Offer the option to sign up or log in using social media accounts. This not only expedites the process but also eliminates the need to remember additional credentials.\n* Provide users with the option to save their cart and come back later to complete the purchase without requiring immediate account creation.\n* If account creation is essential, highlight the benefits of account creation, such as personalized recommendations and order history, to encourage users to create accounts willingly.\n\n\nSlow Delivery of Products\n-------------------------\n\n\nShoppers often expect a specific delivery timeline, and when this estimate is exceeded, it creates a sense of disappointment and unease. The absence of an expedited delivery option limits customer control and convenience, especially for those seeking a swift receipt of their purchase. When faced with the prospect of prolonged wait times, customers may explore alternative sellers or platforms that offer quicker shipping options, potentially leading to abandoned carts.\n\n\n### What to Do:\n\n\nIf your online store fails to deliver products as per the expectations of your customers, they have no other choice but to look for alternatives. Even if you have to charge extra for expedited shipping, do so, but do give an option to your customers.\u00a0\n\n\n* Provide accurate delivery windows at the earliest stage of the shopping journey. This aligns expectations and minimizes surprises.\n* Introduce expedited delivery choices for customers seeking a faster receipt. Offer tiered shipping services to cater to various timelines, such as standard delivery- 3-5 business days, expedited delivery- 1-2 business days, or same-day delivery- within 5-6 hours.\n* Try to offer incentives, such as discounts or loyalty points, to customers who choose standard shipping, acknowledging their patience.\n* Be transparent about your delivery policies. Better to have a detailed page on this and explain why some items can\u2019t have expedited deliveries while others can.\n\n\nConcerns Regarding Sharing Credit Card Information\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBuilding a trustworthy brand is a significant challenge for online businesses. The apprehension around sharing credit card information can significantly influence a customer\u2019s decision to proceed with a purchase. Customers worry about the safety of their sensitive financial information, fearing potential data breaches and unauthorized access.\n\n\n### What to Do:\n\n\nThe fear of credit card fraud or unauthorized charges can be a powerful deterrent, prompting customers to rethink their purchases.\u00a0\n\n\n* Clearly communicate and showcase security measures in place to protect customers\u2019 financial data. Highlight SSL encryption, secure payment gateways, and compliance with data protection regulations.\n* Display recognized trust badges and security seals prominently during the checkout process. These symbols can instill confidence and ease concerns. Including a trust badge like Razorpay\u2019s can help build confidence among customers that their money is safe and encourage them to complete their purchases.\n* Provide easy access to your platform\u2019s privacy policy, detailing how customer data is handled, stored, and protected.\n* Make customer support readily available to address concerns related to payment security, assuaging doubts in real time.\n\n\nRazorpay Trust Badge for cart abandonment issueMultiple Steps to Complete Purchase\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe complexity of multistep checkout processes can have profound effects on a customer\u2019s decision to finalize a purchase. Complicated checkout processes result in 18% of customers abandoning their carts. Lengthy checkout processes with multiple steps increase the cognitive load on customers, leading to decision fatigue and an increased likelihood of cart abandonment.\u00a0\n\n\n### What to Do:\n\n\nCustomers value their time, and if the checkout process takes longer than expected, they might opt for a simpler, quicker transaction elsewhere.\n\n\n* Condense the checkout process onto a single page, allowing customers to view and complete all necessary steps without constant navigation.\n* Offer an option to check out as a guest, eliminating the need for account creation and simplifying the process for one-time shoppers.\n* Utilize auto-fill features to pre-populate fields with information like shipping addresses, making the process faster and more convenient.\n* Get in touch with checkout providers like Razorpay Magic Checkout to streamline the process, reducing the effort and time it takes for customers to pay for their products.\n\n\nReturn Policy Fails to Meet Expectations\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nCustomers seek assurance that they can return products if they\u2019re dissatisfied or encounter issues. A vague or restrictive return policy triggers concerns and prompts cart abandonment. Return policies marred by hidden fees, restocking charges, or complicated return procedures lead customers to perceive returns as burdensome, driving them to abandon their carts. And a return policy with tight timelines for returns doesn\u2019t cater to customer flexibility.\n\n\n### What to Do:\n\n\nReturns will happen, and it is advisable to be transparent about one\u2019s return policy. The more precise and honest you will be about your return policy, the more trust you will instill in your customers.\u00a0\n\n\n* Clearly articulate the return policy on the product pages and during the checkout process. This builds trust and helps customers make informed decisions.\n* Extend return timeframes to provide customers with ample opportunity to evaluate their purchases and return items if needed.\n* Streamline the return process with easy-to-follow instructions, clear contact information, and user-friendly online return request forms.\n* Address customer concerns promptly and professionally around returns and refunds. Assure customers that their inquiries and issues will be handled efficiently.\n\n\nFrequent Crashes and Loading Problems\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nRepeated crashes and slow loading times frustrate users, making their shopping experience unpleasant and prompting them to abandon their carts in search of smoother alternatives. Crashes and loading issues impede customers from completing their desired actions, such as adding items to the cart or proceeding to checkout, leading to abandonment out of sheer inconvenience. Frustrated customers are more likely to explore other online stores where they can shop without disruptions, diverting their attention and purchases away from the problematic site.\n\n\n### What to Do:\n\n\nYour website serves as the ambassador of your brand, presenting your image to the world. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to maintain its seamless operation consistently, devoid of even the slightest glitches.\n\n\n* Perform routine website maintenance to identify and resolve potential issues before they escalate into crashes.\n* Invest in a reliable and scalable hosting infrastructure that can handle traffic spikes and minimize downtime.\n* Ensure the website is fully optimized for mobile devices to prevent loading problems and crashes on different platforms.\n* Conduct rigorous user testing to identify and rectify any usability issues that might contribute to crashes or loading problems.\n\n\nUnavailability of Preferred Payment Option\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nCustomers seek convenience and familiarity. If their preferred payment method is missing, they might opt for a more familiar platform where their choice is supported. The availability of a preferred payment method can sometimes outweigh other considerations, such as price or even the products themselves.\n\n\n### What to Do:\n\n\nIt is always advisable to offer as many payment options as possible to encourage speedy payment. [Cash on delivery](https://razorpay.com/blog/cash-on-delivery/), for example, is the most preferred method in India, you might want to add it to the payment page as well.\u00a0\n\n\n* Offer a wide range of payment methods to cater to various customer preferences, including credit cards, digital wallets, UPI, and more.\n* Analyze customer demographics and preferences to identify the most popular payment methods for your target audience.\n* Connect with checkout partners, like Razorpay Magic Checkout, to make the checkout process 5x faster and display all payment methods in a single screen, including COD.\n* Clearly communicate accepted payment methods on the website, ensuring customers are aware of their options before reaching the checkout stage.\n\n\nPromo or Coupon Codes Unavailable\n---------------------------------\n\n\nIncentives like discounts and coupons are attractive to customers. Customers seek value in their purchases. The absence of promotional discounts or coupon codes can lead them to reconsider, perceiving the purchase as less advantageous. This can lead to customers exploring other online stores in search of better deals.\u00a0\n\n\n### What to Do:\n\n\nMake it easier for them to find and add coupons themselves, but be careful not to overdo it, as it could lead to customers constantly expecting discounts.\n\n\n* Offer strategic promotions, such as seasonal sales, holiday discounts, and limited-time offers, to engage customers and drive purchases.\n* Tailor promotions to individual customer preferences based on browsing behavior, purchase history, or loyalty status.\n* Create loyalty programs that reward repeat customers with exclusive discounts, early access to promotions, or accumulated points for future discounts.\n* Implement abandoned cart recovery strategies that automatically remind customers about their unpurchased items, accompanied by special promo codes to incentivize completion.\n\n\n*Read Also:* [*Return to Origin- Why it Happens, Its Impact, and How to Solve it?*](https://razorpay.com/blog/return-to-origin-challenges-and-how-to-solve-it/)\n\n\nBonus Tip: Reduce Cart Abandonment with Razorpay Magic Checkout.\n================================================================\n\n\nHere\u2019s a quick checklist to remind you about the reasons behind cart abandonment:\n\n\n\u2705Lack of mobile-friendly UI\n\n\n\u2705Added charges, elevating total cost\n\n\n\u2705Unnecessary account creation\n\n\n\u2705Slow delivery of products\n\n\n\u2705Concerns regarding sharing credit card information\n\n\n\u2705Multiple steps to complete purchase\u00a0\n\n\n\u2705Return policy fails to meet expectations\n\n\n\u2705Frequent crashes and loading problems\n\n\n\u2705The desired payment option was not available\n\n\n\u2705There were no available promo or coupon codes\n\n\nCart abandonment is a challenge every e-commerce business faces.

As per Section 194Q, the income tax department mandates any company or individual to deduct tax at the source if the payment exceeds Rs. 50 lakhs for the purchase of goods and services, like rent, consulting, legal fees, royalty, technical services, etc.  \n\n  \n\nThe [TDS rates](https://razorpay.com/blog/tds-rate-chart/) are predecided by the government under the Income Tax Act. Click on the button below to find out the TDS rates on different types of goods and services for FY 2021-22.  \n\nIn any TDS transaction, the company or individual deducting TDS from the payment is called a deductor, and the company or person receiving the said payment is called the deductee.\n\n\n**What is TCS?**\n----------------\n\n\nTax Collected at Source, or TCS is a tax imposed on goods by the seller, who collects it from the buyer at the time of sale. Section 206C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 specifies the goods and services on which TCS is applicable. The threshold for TCS on the sale of goods is Rs. 50 lakhs.\n\n\nAlthough both taxes are levied at the point of origin of income/payment, there are quite a few significant differences between TDS and TCS. Read on to get a clear understanding of the difference between TDS and TCS. \u00a0\n\n\nExamples of TDS and TCS\n-----------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**\u27a1\ufe0fLet\u2019s consider an example of TDS in the context of salary payments:**\n\n\nSuppose you are an employee working for a company. Your monthly salary is Rs. 50,000. As per the income tax regulations, your employer is required to deduct TDS from your salary before making the payment to you.\n\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the applicable TDS rate for your income slab is 10%. In this case, your employer will deduct 10% of your salary as TDS, which amounts to Rs. 5,000 (10% of Rs. 50,000). After deducting TDS, your employer will pay you the remaining amount of Rs. 45,000.\n\n\nThe deducted TDS amount of Rs. 5,000 will be deposited by your employer to the government on your behalf. This TDS can then be claimed as a tax credit while filing your income tax return. The TDS amount is considered as tax already paid by you, which reduces your overall tax liability.\n\n\nSo, in this example, TDS is the amount deducted from your salary by your employer and remitted to the government as income tax on your behalf.\n\n\n**\u27a1\ufe0fNow, Let\u2019s consider an example of TCS in the context of the sale of goods:**\n\n\nSuppose you run a business that sells alcoholic beverages. As a seller, you are required to collect TCS on the sale of alcoholic liquor as per the applicable tax regulations.\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you sell a case of alcoholic liquor to a customer for Rs. 10,000, and the TCS rate for alcoholic liquor is 5%. In this case, you will collect 5% of the sale value, which amounts to Rs. 500 (5% of Rs. 10,000) as TCS.\n\n\nAfter collecting the TCS amount of Rs. 500, you will remit it to the government as per the specified timeline and procedures.\n\n\nThe customer who purchased the alcoholic liquor can adjust the TCS amount of Rs. 500 against their tax liability while filing their income tax return.\n\n\nIn this example, TCS is the amount collected by you as the seller on the sale of alcoholic liquor, and it is subsequently remitted to the government. The TCS serves as tax already paid by the buyer, which can be adjusted against their tax liability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference between TDS and TCS\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TAX DEDUCTED AT SOURCE (TDS)** | **TAX COLLECTED AT SOURCE (TCS)** |\n| **Meaning** |\n| TDS is tax deducted at source by any company or individual making a payment if the payment exceeds the thresholds mentioned under respective sections.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 | TCS is a tax collected by the seller, at the time of sale. |\n| **Transactions Covered** |\n| TDS is applicable on interest, salaries, brokerage, professional fees, commission, purchase of goods, rent, etc. | TCS is applicable on the sale of timber, scrap, minerals, liquor, tendu leaves, forest produce, cars, and toll tickets.\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| **Limits**\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| Under Section 194Q, TDS is applicable on the purchase of goods, if the amount exceeds Rs. 50 lakhs. | Under Section 206C (1H), TCS is applicable on the sale of goods, if the amount exceeds Rs. 50 lakhs. |\n| **Rates** |\n| The tax deduction rate (TDS) for the purchase of goods is 0.1% of the sum exceeding Rs. 50 lakhs. | The tax collection rate (TCS) for the sale of goods is 0.1% of the sale sum exceeding Rs. 50 lakhs. |\n| **Time of Deduction/Collection** |\n| TDS is deducted whenever a payment is due or made, whichever is earlier. | TCS is collected by the seller at the time of sale. |\n| **Person Responsible** |\n| TDS is to be deducted by the individual (or company) making the payment.\u00a0 | TCS is to be collected by the individual (or company) selling the specified goods. |\n| **Due Dates**\u00a0 |\n| The due date for [depositing TDS](https://razorpay.com/x/tds-online-payment/) is the 7th of every month while TDS returns have to be submitted quarterly. | TCS will be deducted during the month in which the supply is made.

It is important to pay your advance tax on time to avoid any penalties or legal consequences.", "[May 3, 2023](https://razorpay.com/learn/business-banking/pre-approved-line-of-credit-usage-benefits/)\n\n5 Mins Read\n\n\nA pre-approved line of credit is a form of financial assistance offered by both NBFCs and traditional financial institutions. It is typically offered to borrowers with excellent repayment records and high credit scores. This type of credit line streamlines the loan application and processing procedures, enabling business owners to obtain significant funding quickly and maintain sufficient cash flow.\n\n\nLenders typically conduct a soft credit inquiry and review your payment history to determine if you are eligible for a pre-approved offer. They will assess your credit score to ensure that it meets their lending criteria and also check your current balance and payment history. If your credit score and payment history meet the lender\u2019s standards, they will then send you a notice of pre-approval.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**How effective is a pre-approved line of credit for businesses?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOne of the main notable features of **pre-approved lines of credit** over a regular loan is that borrowers will only have to pay interest on the withdrawn amount and not on the entire approved credit limit.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is similar to that of a credit card; in a pre-approved line of credit business owners can access the funds whenever they want. Such financing options make it easy for businesses to tide over uncertain times like lean periods. It helps businesses have quick access to short-term capital and ensure they have adequate resources to carry out day-to-day business operations.\u00a0\n\n\n**When to use a pre-approved line of credit?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\nBusiness owners often encounter unforeseen expenses, and having access to a pre-approved line of credit can help them navigate these challenges more easily. A pre-approved line of credit provides businesses with a predetermined amount of funding that they can use to purchase inventory, finance marketing campaigns, and cover seasonal cash flow gaps effectively.\n\n\nPre-approved lines of credit are not intended for acquiring assets, but rather for financing expenses that banks typically do not underwrite loans for. They can be especially beneficial when upfront costs are unknown, or when a significant cost needs to be covered quickly.\n\n\nBy using a pre-approved line of credit for these types of expenses, business owners can help ensure that their operations run smoothly and that they have the resources they need to grow and succeed. However, it\u2019s important to remember that a pre-approved line of credit is not free money and should be used responsibly, with a plan in place to repay the funds in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Reasons businesses choose pre-approved lines of credit**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Instant availability of credit**\n\n\nA pre-approved line of credit is typically offered to existing customers of a financial institution, which means that the lender is already familiar with the borrower\u2019s repayment potential and credit history. As a result, the loan disbursal process is typically faster, which can help businesses address financial needs more quickly.\n\n\n* ### **Competitive interest rates**\n\n\nLenders typically offer a competitive interest rate on pre-approved lines of credit, as they have already evaluated the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness and repayment history. This allows borrowers to save on borrowing costs and allocate the funds towards other business operations.\n\n\n* ### **No documentation**\n\n\nA significant advantage of pre-approved lines of credit is that borrowers can access them without having to go through a lengthy documentation process. This is because these lines of credit are typically offered to existing customers, and lenders already have the necessary documentation on file. In the event that additional documentation is required, borrowers can often submit it online, further streamlining the process.\n\n\n* ### **Zero collateral**\n\n\nOne of the significant benefits of pre-approved lines of credit is that borrowers are not required to pledge any of their valuable assets as collateral. This is particularly advantageous for young entrepreneurs, new businesses, or those who do not have assets to offer as security.\n\n\n* ### **Higher loan amount**\n\n\nLenders typically offer pre-approved lines of credit to borrowers who demonstrate financial responsibility and a good repayment history. As a result, borrowers who qualify for a pre-approved line of credit may have a higher chance of being approved for a larger loan amount, which can be particularly helpful when facing unexpected or significant expenses.\n\n\n* ### **Exemption from hidden charges**\n\n\nLenders might waive additional charges like foreclosure fees, processing fees, prepayment penalties etc., on the pre-approved line of credit. However, this differs from lender to lender.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **Increased flexibility and customisability**\n\n\nPre-approved lines of credit are generally personalised. Hence borrowers can enjoy flexibility, unlike a closed-end loan which one can use for a specific purpose. So, borrowers can use the sanctioned amount to cover payroll, purchase inventory, etc. They can opt for a repayment tenure that best suits their financial position and goals.\u00a0 The flexibility that comes along with these financing choices ensures that availing an external credit option never turns out to be a burden.\u00a0\n\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions:**\n-------------------------------\n\n\n* ### **Does a pre-approved line of credit affect credit score?**\n\n\nLenders, such as Razorpay, do a soft credit check during the [pre-approved loan](https://razorpay.com/x/line-of-credit/?utm_source=Content&utm_medium=Learn&utm_campaign=Navigating+Uncertain+Times%3A+How+Pre-Approved+Line+of+Credit+Can+Provide+Stability+and+Flexibility) application process which does not affect credit scores.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### **What does pre-approved credit limit increase refer to?**\n\n\nWhen lenders offer borrowers a credit limit increase, it is typically an indication that the borrowers have demonstrated financial responsibility and reliability.

As per Marketo, [90% of customer value is obtained after the initial sale](https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/6-steps-for-a-successful-b2b-cross-sell-and-upsell-strategy). Practicing upselling and cross-selling tactics can potentially help you exceed your eCommerce business revenue goals. Top brands are already leveraging upsell and cross-sell features, albeit non-salesy.\u00a0\n\n\nIn this [Razorpay Magic Checkout](https://razorpay.com/magic/), a one-click checkout solution blog post, we will dive deep to understand what upsell and cross-sell are, the apps worth trying on Shopify stores, and more.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat is Upsell and Cross Sell?\n==============================\n\n\nUpsell\n------\n\n\n![what is upsell?](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/blog-content/uploads/2023/05/upsell-1.png)\n\n\nUpsell, or Up-Sell, is upping the sales game by encouraging customers to buy an upgraded, premium, or enhanced version of the product they want to buy in order to increase the purchase amount or ticket size. Here\u2019s an example, when a customer chooses a particular mobile phone model, the online store shows an upgraded version of the same or another model with similar but better features, which would cost slightly more.\u00a0\n\n\nCross Sell\n----------\n\n\n![What is cross sell?](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/blog-content/uploads/2023/05/Cross-sell-.jpg)\n\n\nCross-sell motivates customers to buy additional products that will complement their order. For example, a customer chooses to buy a mobile phone, and the online store suggests mobile phone cases and screen guards to cross-sell additional products and increase their sales value.\u00a0\n\n\nHow to Upsell and Cross Sell?\n=============================\n\n\nNarrow Down the Choices\n-----------------------\n\n\nToo many choices can cause decision fatigue, which is why avoid bombarding your customers with a plethora of options. And if someone doesn\u2019t go for a promoted product, don\u2019t push them. Upsell and cross-sell should not be part of aggressive sales strategies but gentle suggestions.\u00a0\n\n\nTry to Offer Bundles\n--------------------\n\n\nEach extra step a customer takes, whether trying to explore related products or trying to checkout; every additional step can make the decision process more complex. Customers don\u2019t want to feel exhausted while trying to shop online. That\u2019s why try to make every step easy for your customers.\u00a0\n\n\nThe easiest way to cross-sell is by offering bundles, meaning combining a few related items and then letting the customers decide whether they would like to go with the bundle offer or stick to the single product only.\u00a0\n\n\nPrice Anchoring is the Key\n--------------------------\n\n\nPrice anchoring is a good sales tactic to incorporate when trying to cross-sell. Price anchoring is a technique where eCommerce businesses present two or sometimes more relevant products abreast, where one product will be less priced than the other or both of the same price but one with better value or deal.\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, consider a customer wanting to buy a DSLR. The eCommerce store displays a DSLR worth Rs. 30,000 without add-ons or accessories. The same store suggests another DSLR of the same price but with add-ons/accessories, such as an extra flash, camera bag, and an SD card. This persuades customers to think that the one with add-ons is a better deal or value for money. The crux here is not to do price anchoring haphazardly. Think of communicating the message carefully. Think of adding value to your offer.\u00a0\n\n\nNever Be Pushy\n--------------\n\n\nThe thumb rule of upselling and cross-selling is not to be pushy. Recommend products that will make logical sense to the customers, given their existing basket, and will add value to that basket. The more pushy you are, the more the customer will be reluctant to buy.\u00a0\n\n\n* Avoid doing up-selling or cross-selling right when a customer visits your online store.\n* Don\u2019t recommend a host of products just because you want your customers to buy more.\n* Don\u2019t add add-ons on your own when customers add something to their cart, hoping they won\u2019t notice.\n\n\nPost-Purchase Cross-Selling is a Good Idea\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nDon\u2019t think that your opportunity to cross-sell ends after the customers have made their purchase. Once a customer completes their checkout journey, brands typically send a confirmation email confirming their purchase, the price of the product, and the delivery date.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is your opportunity to remind them of additional and relevant products they might find useful. Add links to relevant products to give your customers more value when emailing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n*Read Also: [Your Guide to Creating the Right eCommerce Shipping Strategy](https://razorpay.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping-solution-in-india/)*\n\n\n6 Upsell and Cross-Sell Apps for Shopify Stores\n===============================================\n\n\nKnowing that eCommerce stores would want the best upsell and cross-sell app to add to their Shopify stores, [Razorpay Magic Checkout](https://razorpay.com/magic/), a one-click checkout solution, has dug deep to determine which apps will be the right choice for you, and we have prepared this list based on proper research.\u00a0\n\n\nMonk Cart Upsell & Cross Sell\n-----------------------------\n\n\n![Monk Cart- upsell and cross sell app](https://d6xcmfyh68wv8.cloudfront.net/blog-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-2.34.50-PM.png)\n\n\nRating: 4.9 Stars (250+ reviews)\n\n\nApp Link: [Get the app](https://apps.shopify.com/monk-cart-upsell-cross-sell)\n\n\nPrice: Free | Basic plan starts from 3200 INR/month\n\n\nMonk Cart Upsell & Cross Sell is a powerful tool to increase sales.
